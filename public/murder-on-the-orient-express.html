        <p class="p61 ft11">AN IMPORTANT PASSENGER ON THE TAURUS EXPRESS</p>
        <p class="p62 ft3">
          It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the
          platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway
          guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and
          <nobr>dining-car,</nobr> a <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> and two local
          coaches.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          By the step leading up into the <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> stood a
          young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform conversing, with a
          small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a
          <nobr>pink-tipped</nobr> nose and the two points of an
          <nobr>upward-curled</nobr> moustache.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished
          stranger was not one to be envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his
          part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished French.
          Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of
          course, as there always were in such cases. The
          <nobr>General’s—<span class="ft4">his</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft4"> </span><nobr>General’s—temper</nobr> had grown
          worse and worse. And then there had come this Belgian
          <nobr>stranger—all</nobr> the way from England, it seemed. There had
          been a <nobr>week—a</nobr> week of curious tensity. And then certain
          things had happened. A very distinguished officer had committed
          suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces had suddenly
          lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the
          General, Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General, had suddenly
          looked ten years younger.
        </p>
        <p class="p64 ft3">
          Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the
          stranger. “You have saved us, <span class="ft22">mon cher</span>,”
          said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as
          he spoke. “You have saved the honour of the French
          <nobr>Army—you</nobr> have averted much bloodshed! How can I thank you
          for acceding to my request? To have come so <nobr>far—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting
          reply including the <nobr>phrase—“But</nobr> indeed, do I not remember
          that once you saved my life?” And then the General had made another
          fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past service;
          and with more mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of honour and
          of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily and the
          conversation had ended.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the
          dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot
          by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with all the zeal
          and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of
          him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“To-day</nobr> is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc. “Tomorrow,
          Monday evening, you will be in Stamboul.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations
          on the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be
          somewhat repetitive in character.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id7_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_8">
      <div id="id8_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">
          “And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mais oui</span>. Stamboul, it is a city I have
          never visited. It would be a pity to pass through—
          <span class="ft22">comme ça</span>.” He snapped his fingers
          descriptively. “Nothing <nobr>presses—I</nobr> shall remain there as a
          tourist for a few days.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, who had
          never seen it.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered.
          Lieutenant Dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch.
          Five minutes to <nobr>five—only</nobr> five minutes more!
        </p>
        <p class="p66 ft3">
          Fancying that the other man had noticed his glance, he hastened once
          more into speech. “There are few people travelling this time of year,”
          he said, glancing up at the windows of the
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3"><nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> above them.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p67 ft5">
          “Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!” “That happens?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”</p>
        <p class="p68 ft5">
          “Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe,
          they are bad. “Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“In Germany, too, I have heard.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Eh bien</span>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as
          another pause seemed to be about to occur. “Tomorrow evening at
          <nobr>seven-forty</nobr> you will be in Constantinople.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La Sainte Sophie, I
          have heard it is very fine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p69 ft3">“Magnificent, I believe.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Above their heads the blinds of one of the
          <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> compartments was pushed aside and a young
          woman looked out.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the
          preceding Thursday. Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest
          House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she slept properly.
          Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated
          compartment, she got up and peered out.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly
          lighted platform with loud, furious altercations in Arabic going on
          somewhere. Two men below her window were talking French. One was a
          French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches.
          She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled
          up. It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train
          so terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would
          not go.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was
          about to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man
          removed his hat. What an <nobr>egg-shaped</nobr> head he had! In spite
          of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled. A
          <nobr>ridiculous-looking</nobr> little man. The sort of little man one
          could never take seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out
          beforehand and had kept it till the last minute. It was a very
          beautiful, polished speech.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind. ...</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">En voiture, Monsieur</span>,” said the Wagon Lit
          conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance M. Poirot climbed aboard
          the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand.
          Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk,
          moved slowly forward.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Enfin</span>!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id8_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_9">
      <div id="id9_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Brrrrrrrr</span>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc,
          realising to the full how cold he was.
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Voilà, Monsieur</span>!” The conductor displayed
          to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping
          compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little
          valise of Monsieur, I have put it here.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in it a
          folded note.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Merci, Monsieur</span>.” The conductor became
          brisk and <nobr>business-like.</nobr> “I have the tickets of Monsieur.
          I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in
          Stamboul, I understand?”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?”
          he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, Monsieur. I have only two other
          <nobr>passengers—both</nobr> English. A Colonel from India and a young
          English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Monsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There
          were still two hours before dawn. Conscious of an inadequate night’s
          sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished, M. Poirot
          curled up in a corner and fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          When he awoke it was <nobr>half-past</nobr> nine he sallied forth to
          the restaurant car in search of hot coffee.
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young English
          lady referred to by the conductor. She was tall, slim and
          <nobr>dark—perhaps</nobr> <nobr>twenty-eight</nobr> years of age.
          There was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her
          breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more
          coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling. She
          wore a <nobr>dark-coloured</nobr> travelling dress of some thin
          material eminently suitable for the heated atmosphere of the train.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft23">
          M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused himself by
          studying her without appearing to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of
          herself with perfect ease wherever she went. She had poise and
          efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her features and
          the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head
          with its neat waves of hair, and her
          <nobr>eyes—cool,</nobr> impersonal and grey. But she was, he decided,
          just a little too efficient to be what he called “<span class="ft4"
            >jolie femme</span
          >.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Presently another person entered the restaurant car. This was a tall
          man of between forty and fifty, lean of figure, brown of skin, with
          hair slightly grizzled round the temples.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“The Colonel from India,” said Poirot to himself.</p>
        <p class="p73 ft5">
          The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl. “Morning, Miss Debenham.”
          “Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p74 ft3">
          The Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her. “Any
          objections?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Of course not. Sit down.”</p>
        <p class="p75 ft5">
          “Well, you know, breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.” “I should hope
          not. But I don’t bite.”
        </p>
        <p class="p76 ft3">
          The Colonel sat down. “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion. He gave
          an order for eggs and coffee.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot, but they passed on
          indifferently. Poirot, reading the English mind correctly, knew that
          he had said to himself. “Only some damned foreigner.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id9_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_10">
      <div id="id10_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          True to their nationality, the two English people were not chatty.
          They exchanged a few brief remarks and presently the girl rose and
          went back to her compartment.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both
          completely ignored the third passenger. Their conversation was more
          animated than at breakfast. Colonel Arbuthnot talked of the Punjab and
          occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where, it
          became clear, she had been in a post as governess. In the course of
          conversation they discovered some mutual friends, which had the
          immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff. They
          discussed old Tommy Somebody and old Reggie Someone Else. The Colonel
          inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether
          she was stopping in Stamboul.
        </p>
        <p class="p78 ft3">
          “No, I’m going straight on.” “Isn’t that rather a pity?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I came out this way two years ago and spent three days in Stamboul
          then.”
        </p>
        <p class="p79 ft5">
          “Oh! I see. Well, I may say I’m very glad you are going right through,
          because I am.” He made a kind of clumsy little bow, flushing a little
          as he did so.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “He is susceptible, our Colonel,” thought Hercule Poirot to himself
          with some amusement. “The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”
        </p>
        <p class="p81 ft5">
          Miss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was
          slightly repressive. The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied
          her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent
          scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician Gates,
          standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the
          girl. Poirot was
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">standing near them and heard her murmur:</p>
        <p class="p82 ft3">
          “It’s so beautiful! I <nobr>wish—I</nobr> <nobr>wish—”</nobr> “Yes?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“I wish I could enjoy it!”</p>
        <p class="p83 ft5">
          Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little
          sterner and grimmer. “I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he
          said.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Hush, please. Hush.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed glance in Poirot’s
          direction. Then he went on: “But I don’t like the idea of your being a
          <nobr>governess—at</nobr> the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and
          their tiresome brats.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an
          exploded myth. I can assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid
          of being bullied by <span class="ft22">me</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.
        </p>
        <p class="p84 ft5">
          “Rather an odd little comedy that I watch here,” said Poirot to
          himself thoughtfully. He was to remember that thought of his later.

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          They arrived at Konya that night about <nobr>half-past</nobr> eleven.
          The two English travellers got out to stretch their legs, pacing up
          and down the snowy platform.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station
          through a window pane. After about ten minutes, however, he decided
          that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing after all. He
          made careful preparations, wrapping himself in several coats and
          mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus attired, he
          descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its length. He
          walked out beyond the engine.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct
          figures standing in the shadow of a traffic van. Arbuthnot was
          speaking.

        <p class="p65 ft3"><nobr>“Mary—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The girl interrupted him.</p>
        <p class="p85 ft3">
          “Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind
          <nobr>us—<span class="ft22">then</span>—”</nobr> Discreetly M. Poirot
          turned away. He wondered. ...
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          He would hardly have recognised the cool, efficient voice of Miss
          Debenham. ...
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Curious,” he said to himself.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They
          spoke little to each other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious.
          There were dark circles under her eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          It was about <nobr>half-past</nobr> two in the afternoon when the
          train came to a halt. Heads were poked out of windows. A little knot
          of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing at
          something under the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was
          hurrying past. The man answered, and Poirot drew back his head and,
          turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham who was standing just
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why
          are we stopping?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire
          under the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> Nothing serious. It is put out.
          They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea
          of danger aside as something completely unimportant.
        </p>
        <p class="p86 ft3">
          “Yes, yes, I understand that. But the <span class="ft22">time</span>!”
          “The time?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, this will delay us.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“It is <nobr>possible—yes,”</nobr> agreed Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at 6.55, and one has
          to cross the Bosphorus and catch the Simplon Orient Express on the
          other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two of delay we
          shall miss the connection.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It is possible, yes,” he admitted.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not
          quite steady; her lips, too, were trembling.
        </p>
        <p class="p87 ft3">
          “Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?” he asked. “Yes. Yes,
          it does. <nobr>I—I</nobr> <span class="ft22">must </span>catch that
          train.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel
          Arbuthnot.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train
          started again. It arrived at <nobr>Hayda-passar</nobr> only five
          minutes late, having made up time on the journey.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He
          was separated from his travelling companions on the boat and did not
          see them again.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian
          Hotel.

        <p class="p89 ft11">THE TOKATLIAN HOTEL</p>
        <p class="p90 ft3">
          At the Tokatlian, Hercule Poirot asked for a room with bath. Then he
          stepped over to the concierge’s desk and inquired for letters.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          There were three waiting for him and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a
          little at the sight of the telegram. It was unexpected.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He opened it in his usual neat, unhurried fashion. The printed words
          stood out clearly.
        </p>
        <p class="p91 ft24">
          Development you predicted in Kassner case has come unexpectedly.
          Please return immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="p92 ft23">
          “<span class="ft24">Voilà ce qui est embêtant</span>,” muttered Poirot
          vexedly. He glanced up at the clock. “I shall have to go on
          <nobr>to-night,”</nobr> he said to the concierge. “At what time does
          the Simplon Orient leave?”
        </p>
        <p class="p93 ft5">
          “At nine o’clock, Monsieur.” “Can you get me a sleeper?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Assuredly, Monsieur. There is no difficulty this time of year. The
          trains are almost empty. <nobr>First-class</nobr> or second?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“First.”</p>
        <p class="p94 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Très bien, Monsieur</span>. How far are you going?”
          “To London.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</span>. I will get you a ticket to
          London and reserve your <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> accommodation in the
          <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> coach.”
        </p>
        <p class="p84 ft5">
          Poirot glanced at the clock again. It was ten minutes to eight. “I
          have time to dine?” “But assuredly, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The little Belgian nodded. He went over and cancelled his room order
          and crossed the hall to the restaurant.
        </p>
        <p class="p95 ft3">
          As he was giving his order to the waiter, a hand was placed on his
          shoulder. “Ah, <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>, but this is an
          unexpected pleasure!” said a voice behind him.
        </p>
        <p class="p96 ft5">
          The speaker was a short stout elderly man, his hair cut
          <span class="ft4">en brosse</span>. He was smiling delightedly. Poiret
          sprang up.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“M. Bouc!”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“M. Poirot!”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          M. Bouc was a Belgian, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des
          Wagons Lits, and his acquaintance with the former star of the Belgian
          police force dated back many years.
        </p>
        <p class="p97 ft5">
          “You find yourself far from home, <span class="ft4">mon cher</span>,”
          said M. Bouc. “A little affair in Syria.”
        </p>
        <p class="p98 ft3">
          “Ah! and you return <nobr>home—when?”</nobr> <nobr>“To-night.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Splendid! I, too. That is to say, I go as far as Lausanne, where I
          have affairs. You travel on the Simplon Orient, I presume?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Yes. I have just asked them to get me a sleeper. It was my intention
          to remain here some days, but I have. received a telegram recalling me
          to England on important business.”

      <div id="id13_1">
        <p class="p99 ft23">
          “Ah!” sighed M. Bouc. “<span class="ft24">Les </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft24">affaires—les</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft24"> affaires</span>! But you, you are at the top of
          the tree nowadays, <span class="ft24">mon vieux</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Some little success I have had, perhaps.” Hercule Poirot tried to
          look modest but failed signally.
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">M. Bouc laughed.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“We will meet later,” he said.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches
          out of the soup.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          That difficult task accomplished, he glanced round him whilst waiting
          for the next course. There were only about half a dozen people in the
          restaurant, and of those half dozen there were only two that
          interested Hercule Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          These two sat at a table not far away. The younger was a
          <nobr>likeable-looking</nobr> young man of thirty, clearly an
          American. It was, however, not he but his companion who had attracted
          the little detective’s attention.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He was a man perhaps of between sixty and seventy. From a little
          distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly
          bald head, his domed forehead, the smiling mouth that displayed a very
          white set of false <nobr>teeth—all</nobr> seemed to speak of a
          benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this assumption. They
          were small, <nobr>deep-set</nobr> and crafty. Not only that. As the
          man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the
          room, his gaze stopped on Poirot for a moment and just for that second
          there was a strange malevolence, an unnatural tensity in the glance.
        </p>
        <p class="p101 ft3">Then he rose.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Pay the bill, Hector,” he said.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          His voice was slightly husky in tone. It had a queer, soft, dangerous
          quality.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          When Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge, the other two men were
          just leaving the hotel. Their luggage was being brought down. The
          younger was supervising the process. Presently he opened the glass
          door and said:
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Quite ready now, Mr. Ratchett.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The elder man grunted an assent and passed out.</p>
        <p class="p102 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Eh bien</span>,” said Poirot. “What do you think of
          those two?” “They are Americans,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p103 ft3">
          “Assuredly they are Americans. I meant what did you think of their
          personalities?” “The young man seemed quite agreeable.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And the other?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “To tell you the truth, my friend, I did not care for him. He produced
          on me an unpleasant impression. And you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Hercule Poirot was a moment in replying.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “When he passed me in the restaurant,” he said at last, “I had a
          curious impression. It was as though a wild
          <nobr>animal—an</nobr> animal savage, but savage! you
          <nobr>understand—had</nobr> passed me by.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “And yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Précisément</span>! The <nobr>body—the</nobr>
          <nobr>cage—is</nobr> everything of the most
          <nobr>respectable—but</nobr> through the bars, the wild animal looks
          out.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You are fanciful, <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “It may be so. But I could not rid myself of the impression that evil
          had passed me by very close.”
        </p>
        <p class="p104 ft3">
          “That respectable American gentleman?” “That respectable American
          gentleman.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id13_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_14">
      <div id="id14_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">
          “Well,” said M. Bouc cheerfully, “it may be so. There is much evil in
          the world.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          At that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them. He
          looked concerned and apologetic.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is extraordinary, Monsieur,” he said to Poirot. “There is not one
          <nobr>first-class</nobr> sleeping berth to be had on the train.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Comment</span>?” cried M. Bouc. “At this time of
          year? Ah, without doubt there is some party of
          <nobr>journalists—of</nobr> <nobr>politicians—?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge, turning to him respectfully.
          “But that’s how it is.” “Well, well.” M. Bouc turned to Poirot. “Have
          no fear, my friend. We will arrange something.
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft3">
          There is always one compartment, the No. 16, which is not engaged. The
          conductor sees to that!” He smiled, then glanced up at the clock.
          “Come,” he said, “it is time we started.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          At the station M. Bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the
          <nobr>brown-uniformed</nobr> Wagon Lit conductor.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Good evening, Monsieur. Your compartment is the No. 1.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft23">
          He called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the
          carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destination:
        </p>
        <p class="p107 ft25">ISTANBUL TRIESTE CALAIS</p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">“You are full up <nobr>to-night,</nobr> I hear?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It is incredible, Monsieur. All the world elects to travel
          <nobr>to-night!”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “All the same you must find room for this gentleman here. He is a
          friend of mine. He can have the No. 16.”
        </p>
        <p class="p109 ft5">“It is taken, Monsieur.” “What? The No. 16?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          A glance of understanding passed between them, and the conductor
          smiled. He was a tall sallow man of middle age.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “But yes, Monsieur. As I told you, we are
          <nobr>full—full—everywhere.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “But what passes itself?” demanded M. Bouc angrily. “There is a
          conference somewhere? It is a party?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people
          have elected to travel to- night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “At Belgrade,” he said, “there will be the slip coach from Athens.
          There will also be the <nobr>Bucharest-Paris</nobr> coach. But we do
          not reach Belgrade until <nobr>to-morrow</nobr> evening. The problem
          is for <nobr>to-night.</nobr> There is no
          <nobr>second-class</nobr> berth free?”
        </p>
        <p class="p111 ft5">
          “There is a <nobr>second-class</nobr> berth,
          <nobr>Monsieur—”</nobr> “Well, <nobr>then—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “But it is a lady’s berth. there is already a German woman in the
          <nobr>compartment—a</nobr> lady’s maid.”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">“Là- là, that is awkward,” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p112 ft3">
          “Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said Poirot. “I must travel in
          an ordinary carriage.” “Not at all. Not at all.” He turned once more
          to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It is true,” said the man, “that there is one passenger who has not
          yet arrived.” He spoke slowly, with hesitation.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“But speak then!”</p>

        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “No. 7 <nobr>berth—a</nobr> <nobr>second-class.</nobr> The gentleman
          has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p113 ft3">“Who is it?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “An Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A M. Harris.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “A name of good omen,” said Poirot. “I read my Dickens. M. Harris he
          will not arrive.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Put Monsieur’s luggage in No. 7,” said M. Bouc. “If this M. Harris
          arrives we will tell him that he is too <nobr>late—that</nobr> berths
          cannot be retained so <nobr>long—we</nobr> will arrange the matter one
          way or another. What do I care for a M. Harris?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “As Monsieur pleases,” said the conductor. He spoke to Poirot’s
          porter, directing him where to go. Then he stood aside from the steps
          to let Poirot enter the train.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Tout à fait au bout, Monsieur</span>,” he called.
          “The end compartment but one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat slow progress, since most
          of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          His polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At
          last he reached the compartment indicated. Inside it, reaching up to a
          suitcase, was the tall young American of the Tokatlian.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He frowned as Poirot entered.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made a mistake.” Then,
          laboriously in French: “<span class="ft22"
            >Je crois qua vous avez un erreur</span
          >.”
        </p>
        <p class="p114 ft5">
          Poirot replied in English. “You are Mr. Harris?” “No, my name is
          MacQueen. <nobr>I—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          But at that moment the voice of the Wagon Lit conductor spoke from
          over Poirot’s <nobr>shoulder—an</nobr> apologetic, rather breathless
          voice.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “There is no other berth on the train, Monsieur. The gentleman has to
          come in here.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in
          Poirot’s luggage. Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some
          amusement. Doubtless the man had been
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft5">
          promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use
          of the other traveller. However, even the most munificent of tips lose
          their effect when a Director of the Company is on board and issues his
          orders.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          The conductor emerged from the compartment, having swung the suitcases
          up onto the racks. “<span class="ft22">Voilà, Monsieur</span>,” he
          said. “All is arranged. Yours is the upper berth, the No. 7. We start
          in
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">one minute.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He hurried off down the corridor. Poirot <nobr>re-entered</nobr> the
          compartment.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “A phenomenon I have seldom seen,” he said cheerfully. “A Wagon Lit
          conductor himself puts up the luggage! It is unheard of!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over his
          <nobr>annoyance—had</nobr> probably decided that it was no good to
          take the matter otherwise than philosophically. “The train’s
          remarkably full,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          A whistle blew, there was a long melancholy cry from the engine. Both
          men stepped out into the corridor. Outside a voice shouted, “En
          voiture!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“We’re off,” said MacQueen.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          But they were not quite off. The whistle blew again.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I say, sir,” said the young man suddenly. “If you’d rather have the
          lower <nobr>berth—easier</nobr> and all <nobr>that—well,</nobr> that’s
          all right by me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">A likeable young fellow.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “No, no,” protested Poirot. “I would not deprive <nobr>you—”</nobr>
        </p>

      <div id="id15_2"></div>

          “That’s all <nobr>right—”</nobr> “You are too
          <nobr>amiable—”</nobr> Polite protests on both sides.
        </p>
        <p class="p116 ft5">
          “It is for one night only,” explained Poirot. “At
          <nobr>Belgrade—”</nobr> “Oh! I see. You’re getting out at
          <nobr>Belgrade—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Not exactly. You <nobr>see—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          There was a sudden jerk. Both men swung round to the window, looking
          out at the long lighted platform as it slid slowly past them.

        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The Orient Express had started on its <nobr>three-day</nobr> journey

        <p class="p117 ft11">POIROT REFUSES A CASE</p>
        <p class="p118 ft3">
          M. Hercule Poirot was a little late in entering the
          <nobr>luncheon-car</nobr> on the following day. He had risen early,
          had breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the
          notes of the case that was recalling him to London. He had seen little
          of his travelling companion.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc, who was already seated, gated a greeting and summoned his
          friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found
          himself in the favoured position of being at the table which was
          served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was
          unusually good.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that M. Bouc
          allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment. He
          was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic.
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “Ah!” he sighed. “If I had but the pen of a Balzac! I would depict
          this scene.” He waved a hand.
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">“It is an idea, that,” said Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah, you agree? It has not been done, I think? And
          <nobr>yet—it</nobr> lends itself to romance, my friend. All around us
          are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For
          three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought
          together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from
          each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several
          ways, never perhaps to see each other again.”
        </p>
        <p class="p119 ft3">
          “And yet,” said Poirot, “suppose an <nobr>accident—”</nobr> “Ah, no,
          my <nobr>friend—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “From your point of view it would be regrettable, I agree. But
          nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all
          these here are linked <nobr>together—by</nobr> death.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Some more wine,” said M. Bouc, hastily pouring it out. “You are
          morbid, <span class="ft4">mon cher</span>. It is, perhaps the
          digestion.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is true,” agreed Poirot, “that the food in Syria was not perhaps
          quite suited to my stomach.”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully
          round the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> There were thirteen people seated
          there and, as M. Bouc had said, of all classes and nationalities. He
          began to study them.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          At the table opposite them were three men. They were, he guessed,
          single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of
          the restaurant attendants. A big swarthy Italian was picking his teeth
          with gusto. Opposite him a spare neat Englishman had the
          expressionless disapproving face of the
          <nobr>well-trained</nobr> servant. Next to the Englishman was a big
          American in a loud <nobr>suit—possibly</nobr> a commercial traveller.
        </p>
        <p class="p120 ft3">
          “You’ve got to put it over <span class="ft22">big</span>,” he was
          saying in a loud, nasal voice. The Italian removed his toothpick to
          gesticulate with it freely. “Sure,” he said. “That whatta I say alla
          de time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p121 ft3">
          The Englishman looked out of the window and coughed. Poirot’s eye
          passed on.

      <div id="id18_1">
        <p class="p99 ft5">
          At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of the ugliest old
          ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of
          <nobr>distinction—it</nobr> fascinated rather than repelled. She sat
          very upright. Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which,
          improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with
          rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small
          and expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow,
          <nobr>toad-like</nobr> face beneath it.
        </p>
        <p class="p64 ft3">
          She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear,
          courteous, but completely autocratic tone.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You will be sufficiently amiable to place in my compartment a bottle
          of mineral water and a large glass of orange juice. You will arrange
          that I shall have chicken cooked without sauces for dinner this
          <nobr>evening—also</nobr> some boiled fish.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The attendant replied respectfully that it should be done.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose. Her glance caught
          Poirot’s and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested
          aristocrat.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is Princess Dragomiroff,” said M. Bouc in a low tone. “She is a
          Russian. Her husband realised all his money before the Revolution and
          invested it abroad. She is extremely rich. A cosmopolitan.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          Poirot nodded. He had heard of Princess Dragomiroff.
        </p>
        <p class="p122 ft3">
          “She is a personality,” said M. Bouc. “Ugly as sin but she makes
          herself felt. You agree?” Poirot agreed.
        </p>
        <p class="p123 ft3">
          At another of the large tables Mary Debenham was sitting with two
          other women. One of them was tall and <nobr>middle-aged,</nobr> in a
          plaid blouse and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair
          unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long
          mild amiable face rather like a sheep. She was listening to the third
          woman, a stout, <nobr>pleasant-faced,</nobr> elderly person who was
          talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for
          breath or coming to a stop.
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft5">
          <nobr>“—and</nobr> so my daughter said, ‘Why,’ she said, ‘you just
          can’t apply American methods in this country. It’s natural to the
          folks here to be indolent,’ she said. ‘They just haven’t got any
          hustle in <nobr>them—’</nobr> But all the same you’d be surprised to
          know what our college there is doing. They’ve got a fine staff of
          teachers. I guess there’s nothing like education. We’ve got to apply
          our Western ideals and teach the East to recognise them. My daughter
          <nobr>says—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p125 ft3">
          The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm, monotonous voice was
          drowned.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          At the next table, a small one, sat Colonel
          <nobr>Arbuthnot—alone.</nobr> His gaze was fixed upon the back of Mary
          Debenham’s head. They were not sitting together. Yet it could easily
          have been managed. Why?
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          Perhaps, Poirot thought, Mary Debenham had demurred. A governess
          learns to be careful. Appearances are important. A girl with her
          living to get has to be discreet.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          His glance shifted to the other side of the carriage. At the far end,
          against the wall, was a <nobr>middle-aged</nobr> woman dressed in
          black with a broad, expressionless face. German or Scandinavian, he
          thought. Probably the German <nobr>lady’s-maid.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Beyond her were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly
          together. The man wore English clothes of loose tweed, but he was not
          English. Though only the back of his head was visible to Poirot, the
          shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well
          made. He turned his head suddenly and Poirot saw his profile. A very
          handsome man of <nobr>thirty-odd</nobr> with a big fair moustache.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          The woman opposite him was a mere <nobr>girl—twenty</nobr> at a guess.
          A <nobr>tight-fitting</nobr> little black coat and skirt, white satin
          blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous
          angle.

    <div id="page_19">
      <div id="id19_1">
        <p class="p43 ft3">
          She had a beautiful <nobr>foreign-looking</nobr> face, dead white
          skin, large brown eyes, jet black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in
          a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one
          large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and
          voice.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Elle est </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft4">jolie—et</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft4"> chic</span>,” murmured Poirot. “Husband and
          <nobr>wife—eh?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          M. Bouc nodded. “Hungarian Embassy, I believe,” he said. “A handsome
          couple.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          There were only two more <nobr>lunchers—Poirot’s</nobr> fellow
          traveller MacQueen and his employer Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat
          facing Poirot, and for the second time Poirot studied that
          unprepossessing face, noting the false benevolence of the brow and the
          small, cruel eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="p126 ft3">
          Doubtless M. Bouc saw a change in his friend’s expression. “It is at
          your wild animal you look?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot nodded.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          As his coffee was brought to him, M. Bouc rose to his feet. Having
          started before Poirot he had finished some time ago.
        </p>
        <p class="p127 ft5">
          “I return to my compartment,” he said. “Come along presently and
          converse with me.” “With pleasure.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot sipped his coffee and ordered a liqueur. The attendant was
          passing from table to table with his box of money, accepting payment
          for bills. The elderly American lady’s voice rose shrill and
          plaintive.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “My daughter said: ‘Take a book of food tickets and you’ll have no
          <nobr>trouble—no</nobr> trouble at all.’ Now, that isn’t so. Seems
          they have to have a ten per cent tip, and then there’s that bottle of
          mineral <nobr>water—and</nobr> a queer sort of water too. They didn’t
          have any Evian or Vichy, which seems queer to me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “It <nobr>is—they</nobr> <nobr>must—how</nobr> do you
          <nobr>say?—serve</nobr> the water of the country,” explained the
          sheep- faced lady.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, it seems queer to me.” She looked distastefully at the heap of
          small change on the table in front of her. “Look at all this peculiar
          stuff he’s given me. Dinars or something. Just a lot of rubbish, it
          looks like! My daughter <nobr>said—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Mary Debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the
          other two. Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Gathering up her
          despised money the American woman followed suit, followed by the other
          one like a sheep. The Hungarians had already departed. The restaurant
          car was empty save for Poirot and Ratchett and MacQueen.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Ratchett spoke to his companion, who got up and left the car. Then he
          rose himself, but instead of following MacQueen he dropped
          unexpectedly into the seat opposite Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Can you oblige me with a light?” he said. His voice was
          <nobr>soft—faintly</nobr> nasal. “My name is Ratchett.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          Poirot bowed slightly. He slipped his hand into his pocket and
          produced a matchbox which he handed to the other man, who took it but
          did not strike a light.
        </p>
        <p class="p128 ft3">
          “I think,” he went on, “that I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr.
          Hercule Poirot. Is that so?” Poirot bowed again. “You have been
          correctly informed, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The detective was conscious of those strange shrewd eyes summing him
          up before the other spoke again.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “In my country,” he said, “we come to the point quickly. Mr. Poirot, I
          want you to take on a job for me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Hercule Poirot’s eyebrows went up a trifle.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “My <span class="ft22">clientèle</span>, Monsieur, is limited
          nowadays. I undertake very few cases.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id19_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_20">
      <div id="id20_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “Why, naturally, I understand that. But this, Mr. Poirot, means big
          money.” He repeated again in his soft, persuasive voice, “Big money.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Hercule Poirot was silent a minute or two. Then he said: “What is it
          you wish me to do for you, <nobr>Monsieur—er—Ratchett?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Mr. Poirot, I am a rich <nobr>man—a</nobr> very rich man. Men in that
          position have enemies. I have an enemy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Only one enemy?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Just what do you mean by that question?” asked Ratchett sharply.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Monsieur, in my experience when a man is in a position to have, as
          you say, enemies, then it does not usually resolve itself into one
          enemy only.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Ratchett seemed relieved <nobr>by—Poirot’s</nobr> answer. He said
          quickly:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Why, yes, I appreciate that point. Enemy or
          <nobr>enemies—it</nobr> doesn’t matter. What does matter is my
          safety.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Safety?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “My life has been threatened, Mr. Poirot. Now I’m a man who can take
          pretty good care of himself.” From the pocket of his coat his hand
          brought a small automatic into sight for a moment. He continued
          grimly. “I don’t think I’m the kind of man to be caught napping. But,
          as I look at it, I might as well make assurance doubly sure. I fancy
          you’re the man for my money, Mr. Poirot. And
          <nobr>remember—<span class="ft4">big</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft4"> </span>money.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for some minutes. His face was
          completely expressionless. The other could have had no clue as to what
          thoughts were passing in that mind.
        </p>
        <p class="p129 ft5">
          “I regret, Monsieur,” he said at length, “that I cannot oblige you.”
          The other looked at him shrewdly. “Name your figure, then,” he said.
          Poirot shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You do not understand, Monsieur. I have been very fortunate in my
          profession. I have made enough money to satisfy both my needs and my
          caprices. I take now only such cases <nobr>as—interest</nobr> me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p130 ft23">
          “You’ve got a pretty good nerve,” said Ratchett. “Will twenty thousand
          dollars tempt you?” “It will not.”
        </p>
        <p class="p131 ft5">
          “If you’re holding out for more, you won’t get it. I know what a
          thing’s worth to me.” “I, also, M. Ratchett.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What’s wrong with my proposition?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Poirot rose. “If you will forgive me for being
          <nobr>personal—I</nobr> do not like your face, M. Ratchett,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">And with that he left the restaurant car.</p>

        <p class="p132 ft11">A CRY IN THE NIGHT</p>
        <p class="p118 ft5">
          The Simplon Orient Express arrived at Belgrade at a quarter to nine
          that evening. It was not due to depart again until 9.15, so Poirot
          descended to the platform. He did not, however, remain there long. The
          cold was bitter, and though the platform itself was protected, heavy
          snow was falling outside. He returned to his compartment. The
          conductor, who was on the platform stamping his feet and waving his
          arms to keep warm, spoke to him.
        </p>
        <p class="p64 ft3">
          “Your valises have been moved, Monsieur. To the compartment No. 1, the
          compartment of M. Bouc.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“But where is Monsieur Bouc, then?”</p>
        <p class="p133 ft5">
          “He has moved into the coach from Athens which has just been put on.”
          Poirot went in search of his friend. M. Bouc waved his protestations
          aside.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is nothing. It is nothing. It is more convenient like this. You
          are going through to England, so it is better that you should stay in
          the through coach to Calais. Me, I am very well here. It is most
          peaceful. This coach is empty save for myself and one little Greek
          doctor. Ah! my friend, what a night! They say there has not been so
          much snow for years. Let us hope we shall not be held up. I am not too
          happy about it, I can tell you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          At 9.15 punctually the train pulled out of the station, and shortly
          afterwards Poirot got up, said good night to his friend, and made his
          way along the corridor back into his own coach which was in front next
          to the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          On this, the second day of the journey, barriers were breaking down.
          Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door of his compartment talking
          to MacQueen. When MacQueen saw Poirot he broke off something he was
          saying. He looked very much surprised.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Why,” he cried, “I thought you’d left us. You said you were getting
          off at Belgrade.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You misunderstood me,” said Poirot, smiling. “I remember now, the
          train started from Stamboul just as we were talking about it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“But, man, your baggage. It’s gone.”</p>
        <p class="p134 ft5">
          “It has been moved into another compartment, that is all.” “Oh! I
          see.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He resumed his conversation with Arbuthnot, and Poirot passed on down
          the corridor.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Two doors from his own compartment, the elderly American, Mrs.
          Hubbard, was standing talking to the <nobr>sheep-like</nobr> lady, who
          was a Swede. Mrs. Hubbard was pressing a magazine on the other.
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft23">
          “No, do take it, my dear,” she said. “I’ve got plenty of other things
          to read. My, isn’t the cold something frightful?” She nodded amicably
          to Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You are most kind,” said the Swedish lady.</p>
        <p class="p136 ft5">
          “Not at all. I hope you’ll sleep well and that your head will be
          better in the morning.” “It is the cold only. I make now myself a cup
          of tea.”
        </p>
        <p class="p137 ft23">
          “Have you got some aspirin? Are you sure now? I’ve got plenty. Well,
          good night, my dear.” She turned to Poirot conversationally as the
          other woman departed.

        <p class="p138 ft3">
          “Poor creature, she’s a Swede. As far as I can make out she’s a kind
          of missionary. A teaching one. A nice creature, but doesn’t talk much
          English. She was <span class="ft22">most </span>interested in what I
          told her about my daughter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot, by now, knew all about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter. Everyone on
          the train who could understand English did! How she and her husband
          were on the staff of a big American college in Smyrna, and how this
          was Mrs. Hubbard’s first journey to the East, and what she thought of
          the Turks and their slipshod ways and the condition of their roads.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The door next to them opened and the thin pale manservant stepped out.
          Inside, Poirot caught a glimpse of Mr. Ratchett sitting up in bed. He
          saw Poirot and his face changed, darkening with anger. Then the door
          was shut.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard drew Poirot a little wide.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You know, I’m dead scared of that man. Oh! not the
          <nobr>valet—the</nobr> other. His master. Master, indeed! There’s
          something <span class="ft22">wrong </span>about that man. My daughter
          always says I’m very intuitive. ‘When Mamma gets a hunch, she’s dead
          right,’ that’s what my daughter says. And I’ve got a hunch about that
          man. He’s next door to me and I don’t like it. I put my grips against
          the communicating door last night. I thought I heard him trying the
          handle. Duo you know, I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if that man
          turned out to be a <nobr>murderer—one</nobr> of these train robbers
          you read about. I daresay I’m foolish, but there it is. I’m absolutely
          scared to death of the man! My daughter said I’d have an easy journey,
          but somehow I don’t feel happy about it. It may be foolish, but I feel
          as if anything might <nobr>happen—anything</nobr> at all. And how that
          nice young fellow can bear to be his secretary, I can’t think.”
        </p>
        <p class="p101 ft3">
          Colonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming towards them down the
          corridor.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Come into my carriage,” MacQueen was saying. “It isn’t made up for
          the night yet. Now what I want to get right about your policy in India
          is <nobr>this—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The two men passed and went on down the corridor to MacQueen’s
          carriage.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Mrs. Hubbard said good night to Poirot. “I guess I’ll go right to bed
          and read,” she said. “Good night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Good night, Madame.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot passed into his own compartment, which was the next one beyond
          Ratchett’s. He undressed and got into bed, read for about half an hour
          and then turned out the light.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He awoke some hours later, awoke with a start. He knew what it was
          that had wakened him— a loud groan, almost a cry, somewhere close at
          hand. At the same moment the ting of a bell sounded sharply.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was
          at a standstill— presumably at a station.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          That cry had startled him. He remembered that it was Ratchett who had
          the next compartment. He got out of bed and opened the door just as
          the Wagon Lit conductor came hurrying along the corridor and knocked
          on Ratchett’s door. Poirot kept his door open a crack and watched. The
          conductor tapped a second time. A bell rang and a light showed over
          another door farther down. The conductor glanced over his shoulder. At
          the same moment a voice from within the next compartment called out:
          “<span class="ft4">Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</span>.” The conductor scurried off
          again, to knock at the door where the light was showing.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot returned to bed, his mind relieved, and switched off the light.
          He glanced at his watch. It was just <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes
          to one.
        </p>

        <p class="p139 ft11">THE CRIME</p>
        <p class="p118 ft3">
          He found it difficult to go to sleep again at once. For one thing he
          missed the motion of the train. If it <span class="ft22">was </span>a
          station outside, it was curiously quiet. By contrast the noises on the
          train seemed unusually loud. He could hear Ratchett moving about next
          <nobr>door—a</nobr> click as he pulled down the washbasin, the sound
          of the tap running, a splashing noise, then another click as the basin
          shut to again. Footsteps passed up the corridor outside, the shuffling
          footsteps of someone in bedroom slippers.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          Hercule Poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling. Why was the station
          outside so silent? His throat felt dry. He had forgotten to ask for
          his usual bottle of mineral water. He looked at his watch again. Just
          after a quarter past one. He would ring for the conductor and ask for
          some mineral water. His finger went out to the bell, but he paused as
          in the stillness he heard a ting. The man couldn’t answer every bell
          at once.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">Ting. ... Ting. ... Ting. ...</p>
        <p class="p140 ft5">
          It sounded again and again. Where was the man? Somebody was getting
          impatient. <nobr><span class="ft4">Ti-i-i-ing!</span></nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Whoever it was, was keeping a finger solidly on the
          <nobr>push-button.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Suddenly with a rush, his footsteps echoing up the aisle, the man
          came. He knocked at a door not far from Poirot’s own.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Then came <nobr>voices—the</nobr> conductor’s, deferential,
          apologetic; and a woman’s, insistent and voluble.
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard!</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot smiled to himself.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The <nobr>altercation—if</nobr> it was <nobr>one—went</nobr> on for
          some time. Its proportions were ninety per cent of Mrs. Hubbard’s to a
          soothing ten per cent of the conductor’s. Finally the matter seemed to
          be adjusted. Poirot heard distinctly a “<span class="ft4"
            >Bonne nuit, Madame</span
          >,” and a closing door.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He pressed his own finger on the bell.</p>
        <p class="p141 ft3">
          The conductor arrived promptly. He looked hot and worried. “<span
            class="ft22"
            >De l’eau minérale, s’il vous Plaît</span
          >.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Bien, Monsieur</span>.” Perhaps a twinkle in
          Poirot’s eye led him to unburden himself. “<span class="ft4"
            >La dame </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft4">américaine</span>—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He wiped his forehead. “Imagine to yourself the time I have had with
          her! She <nobr>insists—but</nobr>
          <nobr><span class="ft4">insists</span>—that</nobr> there is a man in
          her compartment! Figure to yourself, Monsieur. In a space of this
          size.” He swept a hand round. “Where would he conceal himself? I argue
          with her. I point out that it is impossible. She insists. She woke up,
          and there was a man there. And how, I ask, did he get out and leave
          the door bolted behind him? But she will not listen to reason. As
          though there were not enough to worry us already. This
          <nobr>snow—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Snow?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But yes, Monsieur. Monsieur has not noticed? The train has stopped.
          We have run into a snowdrift. Heaven knows how long we shall be here.
          I remember once being snowed up for seven days.”

        <p class="p142 ft3">
          “Between Vincovci and Brod.” <nobr>“Là-là,”</nobr> said Poirot
          vexedly.
        </p>
        <p class="p143 ft5">
          The man withdrew and returned with the water. “<span class="ft4"
            >Bon soir, Monsieur</span

        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot drank a glass of water and composed himself to sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He was just dropping off when something again woke him. This time it
          was as though something heavy had fallen with a thud against the door.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He sprang up, opened it and looked out. Nothing. But to his right,
          some distance down the corridor, a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono
          was retreating from him. At the other end, sitting on his little seat,
          the conductor was entering up figures on large sheets of paper.
          Everything was deathly quiet.
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “Decidedly I suffer from the nerves,” said Poirot and retired to bed
          again. This time he slept till morning.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          When he awoke the train was still at a standstill. He raised a blind
          and looked out. Heavy banks of snow surrounded the train.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          He glanced at his watch and saw that it was past nine o’clock.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          At a quarter to ten, neat, spruce and dandified as ever, he made his
          way to the restaurant car, where a chorus of woe was going on.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Any barriers there might have been between the passengers had now
          quite broken down. All were united by a common misfortune. Mrs.
          Hubbard was loudest in her lamentations.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “My daughter said it would be the easiest way in the world. Just sit
          in the train until I got to Parrus. And now we may be here for days
          and days,” she wailed. “And my boat sails day after
          <nobr>to-morrow.</nobr> How am I going to catch it now? Why, I can’t
          even wire to cancel my passage. I’m just too mad to talk about it!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The Italian said that he had urgent business himself in Milan. The
          large American said that that was “too bad, Ma’am,” and soothingly
          expressed a hope that the train might make up time.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “My <nobr>sister—her</nobr> children wait me,” said the Swedish lady,
          and wept. “I get no word to them. What they think? They will say bad
          things have happen to me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “How long shall we be here?” demanded Mary Debenham. “Doesn’t anybody
          <span class="ft22">know</span>?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Her voice sounded impatient, but Poirot noted that there were no signs
          of that almost feverish anxiety which she had displayed during the
          check to the Taurus Express.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard was off again.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “There isn’t anybody knows a thing on this train. And nobody’s trying
          to <span class="ft22">do </span>anything. Just a pack of useless
          foreigners. Why, if this were at home, there’d be someone at least
          <span class="ft22">trying </span>to do something!”

          Arbuthnot turned to Poirot and spoke in careful British French.

        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Not at all. It is most natural. I am now in the compartment that he

        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          M. Bouc was not present in the restaurant car. Poirot looked about to
          notice who else was absent.

        <p class="p146 ft3">
          Princess Dragomiroff was missing, and the Hungarian couple. Also

        <p class="p147 ft3">
          “I am foolish,” she said. “I am bad to cry. All is for the best,
          whatever happen.” This Christian spirit, however, was far from being
          shared.
        </p>
        <p class="p148 ft5">
          “That’s all very well,” said MacQueen restlessly. “We may be here for
          days.” “What <span class="ft4">is </span>this country anyway?”
          demanded Mrs. Hubbard tearfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          On being told it was <nobr>Jugo-Slavia,</nobr> she said: “Oh! one of
          these Balkan things. What can you expect?”
        </p>
        <p class="p149 ft3">
          “You are the only patient one, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot to Miss
          Debenham. She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “What can one do?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You are a philosopher, Mademoiselle.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That implies a detached attitude. I think my attitude is more
          selfish. I have learned to save myself useless emotion.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She was speaking more to herself than to him. She was not even looking
          at him. Her gaze went past him, out of the window to where the snow
          lay in heavy masses.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You are a strong character, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “You
          are, I think, the strongest character amongst us.”
        </p>
        <p class="p97 ft3">
          “Oh! no. No, indeed. I know one far, far stronger than I am.” “And
          that <nobr>is—?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She seemed suddenly to come to herself, to realise that she was
          talking to a stranger and foreigner, with whom, until this morning,
          she had exchanged only half a dozen sentences.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She laughed, a polite but estranging laugh.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“Well—that</nobr> old lady, for instance. You have probably
          noticed her. A very ugly old lady but rather fascinating. She has only
          to lift a little finger and ask for something in a polite
          <nobr>voice—and</nobr> the whole train runs.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It runs also for my friend M. Bouc,” said Poirot. “But that is
          because he is a director of the line, not because he has a strong
          character.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Mary Debenham smiled.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The morning wore away. Several people, Poirot amongst them, remained
          in the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> The communal life was felt, at the
          moment, to pass the time better. He heard a good deal more about Mrs.
          Hubbard’s daughter, and he heard the lifelong habits of Mr. Hubbard,
          deceased, from his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with
          a cereal to his final rest at night in the <nobr>bed-socks</nobr> that
          Mrs. Hubbard herself had been in the habit of knitting for him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          It was when he was listening to a confused account of the missionary
          aims of the Swedish lady that one of the Wagon Lit conductors came
          into the car and stood at his elbow.
        </p>

          <span class="ft3">“</span>Pardon, Monsieur<span class="ft3"

          “The compliments of M. Bouc, and he would be glad if you would be so
          kind as to come to him for a few minutes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Poirot rose, uttered excuses to the Swedish lady and followed the man
          out of the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> It was not his own conductor, but
          a big fair man.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          He followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage and along
          the corridor of the next one. The man tapped at a door, then stood
          aside to let Poirot enter.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The compartment was not M. Bouc’s own. It was a
          <nobr>second-class</nobr> <nobr>one—chosen</nobr> presumably because
          of its slightly larger size. It certainly gave the impression of being
          crowded.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          M. Bouc himself was sitting on the small seat in the opposite corner.
          In the corner next the window, facing him, was a small dark man
          looking out at the snow. Standing up and quite

          preventing Poirot from advancing any farther were a big man in blue
          uniform (the <span class="ft24">chef de train</span>) and his own
          Wagon Lit conductor.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Ah! my good friend,” cried M. Bouc. “Come in. We have need of you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The little man in the window shifted along the seat, and Poirot
          squeezed past: the other two men and sat down facing his friend.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The expression on M. Bouc’s face gave him, as he would have expressed
          it, furiously to think. It was clear that something out of the common
          had happened.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What has occurred?” he asked.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You may well ask that. First this <nobr>snow-this</nobr> stoppage.
          And <nobr>now—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p152 ft5">
          He <nobr>paused—and</nobr> a sort of strangled gasp came from the
          Wagon Lit conductor. “And now what?”

        <p class="p75 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">“</span>And now a passenger lies dead in his

            M. Bouc spoke with a kind of calm desperation.</span

        <p class="p5 ft5">“A passenger? Which passenger?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “An American. A man <nobr>called—called—”</nobr> he consulted some
          notes in front of him. “Ratchett. That is
          <nobr>right—Ratchett?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p94 ft3">
          “Yes, Monsieur,” the Wagon Lit man gulped. Poirot looked at him. He
          was as white as chalk.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “You had better let that man sit down,” he said. “He may faint
          otherwise.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>moved slightly and the
          Wagon Lit man sank down in the corner and buried his face in his
          hands.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Brr</span>!” said Poirot. “This is serious!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Certainly it is serious. To begin with, a <nobr>murder—that</nobr> in
          itself is a calamity of the first water. But not only that, the
          circumstances are unusual. Here we are, brought to a standstill. We
          may be here for <nobr>hours—and</nobr> not only
          <nobr>hours—days!</nobr> Another
          <nobr>circumstance—passing</nobr> through most countries we have the
          police of that country on the train. But in
          <nobr>Jugo-Slavia,</nobr> no. You comprehend?”
        </p>
        <p class="p153 ft3">
          “It is a position of great difficulty,” said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “There is worse to come. Dr. <nobr>Constantine—I</nobr> forgot, I have
          not introduced you. Dr. Constantine, M. Poirot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The little dark man bowed, and Poirot returned the bow.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Dr. Constantine is of the opinion that death occurred at about 1
          A.M.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is difficult to speak exactly in these matters,” said the doctor,
          “but I think I can say definitely that death occurred between midnight
          and two in the morning.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “When was this M. Ratchett last seen alive?” asked Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “He is known to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one, when
          he spoke to the conductor,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is quite correct,” said Poirot. “I myself heard what passed.
          That is the last thing known?”

        <p class="p110 ft3">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">Poirot turned toward the doctor, who continued.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The window of M. Ratchett’s compartment was found wide open, leading
          one to suppose that the murderer escaped that way. But in my opinion
          that open window is a blind. Anyone departing that way would have left
          distinct traces in the snow. There were none.”
        </p>
        <p class="p155 ft3">

          The Wagon Lit conductor sat up. His face still looked pale and

          Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The man spoke somewhat jerkily.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The valet of this M. Ratchett, he tapped several times at the door
          this morning. There was no answer. Then, half an hour ago, the
          restaurant car attendant came. He wanted to know if Monsieur was
          taking <span class="ft4">déjeuner</span>. It was eleven o’clock, you
          comprehend.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I open the door for him with my key. But there is a chain, too, and
          that is fastened. There is no answer and it is very still in there,
          and <nobr>cold—but</nobr> cold. With the window open and snow drifting
          in. I thought the gentleman had had a fit, perhaps. I got the

        <p class="p154 ft3">He buried his face in his hands again.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “The door was locked and chained on the inside,” said Poirot
          thoughtfully. “It was not <nobr>suicide—eh?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          The Greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh. “Does a man who commits
          suicide stab himself in <nobr>ten—twelve—fifteen</nobr> places?” he
          asked.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot’s eyes opened. “That is great ferocity,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is a woman,” said the <span class="ft22">chef de train</span>,
          speaking for the first time. “Depend upon it, it was a woman. Only a
          woman would stab like that.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Dr. Constantine screwed up his face thoughtfully.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “She must have been a very strong woman,” he said. “It is not my
          desire to speak <nobr>technically—that</nobr> is only confusing; but I
          can assure you that one or two of the blows were delivered with such
          force as to drive them through hard belts of bone and muscle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It was clearly not a scientific crime,” said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It was most unscientific,” returned Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem
          to have been delivered haphazard and at random. Some have glanced off,
          doing hardly any damage. It is as though somebody had shut his eyes
          and then in a frenzy struck blindly again and again.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">C’est une femme</span>,” said the
          <span class="ft22">chef de train </span>again. “Women are like that.
          When they are enraged they have great strength.” He nodded so sagely
          that everyone suspected a personal experience of his own.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I have, perhaps, something to contribute to your store of knowledge,”
          said Poirot. “M. Ratchett spoke to me yesterday. He told me, as far as
          I was able to understand him, that he was in danger of his life.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          <span class="ft3">“</span><span class="ft26">‘Bumped </span
          ><nobr>off’—that</nobr> is the American expression, is it not?” asked
          M. Bouc. “Then it is not a woman. It is a ‘gangster’ or a ‘gunman.’ ”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>looked pained at seeing his
          theory come to nought.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “If so,” said Poirot, “it seems to have been done very amateurishly.”
          His tone expressed professional disapproval.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “There is a large American on the train,.” said M. Bouc, pursuing his
          idea. “A common- looking man with terrible clothes. He chews the gum,
          which I believe is not done in good circles. You know whom I mean?”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          The Wagon Lit conductor to whom he had appealed nodded.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Oui, Monsieur</span>, the No. 16. But it cannot
          have been he. I should have seen him enter or leave the compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “You might not. You might not. But we will go into that presently. The
          question is, what to do?” He looked at Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked back at him.</p>

          “Come, my friend,” said M. Bouc. “You comprehend what I am about to
          ask of you. I know your powers. Take command of this investigation!
          No, no, do not refuse. See, to us it is <nobr>serious—I</nobr> speak
          for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. By the time the
          Jugo- Slavian police arrive, how simple if we can present them with
          the solution! Otherwise delays, annoyances, a million and one
          inconveniences. Perhaps, who knows, serious annoyance to innocent
          persons. <nobr>Instead—<span class="ft22">you</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> </span>solve the mystery! We say, ‘A murder has
          <nobr>occurred—<span class="ft22">this</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> </span>is the criminal!’”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“And suppose I do not solve it?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Ah, <span class="ft22">mon cher</span>!” M. Bouc’s voice became
          positively caressing. “I know your reputation. I know something of
          your methods. This is the ideal case for you. To look up the
          antecedents of all these people, to discover their
          <span class="ft22">bona </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft22">fides</span>—all</nobr> that takes time and
          endless inconvenience. But have I not heard you say often that to
          solve a case a man has only to lie back in his chair and think? Do
          that. Interview the passengers on the train, view the body, examine
          what clues there are, and <nobr>then—well,</nobr> I have faith in you!
          I am assured that it is no idle boast of yours. Lie back and
          <nobr>think—use</nobr> (as I have heard you say so often) the little
          grey cells of the <nobr>mind—and</nobr> you will
          <span class="ft22">know</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p101 ft3">
          He leaned forward, looking affectionately at the detective.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Your faith touches me, my friend,” said Poirot emotionally. “As you
          say, this cannot be a difficult case. I myself last
          <nobr>night—but</nobr> we will not speak of that now. In truth, this
          problem intrigues me. I was reflecting, not half an hour ago, that
          many hours of boredom lay ahead whilst we are stuck here. And
          <nobr>now—a</nobr> problem lies ready to my hand.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You accept then?” said M. Bouc eagerly.</p>
        <p class="p157 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">C’est entendu</span>. You place the matter in my
          hands.” <nobr>“Good—we</nobr> are all at your service.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “To begin with, I should like a plan of the
          <nobr>Istanbul-Calais</nobr> coach, with a note of the people who
          occupied the several compartments, and I should also like to see their
          passports and their tickets.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“Michel will get you those.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor left the compartment.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “What other passengers are there on the train?” asked Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “In this coach Dr. Constantine and I are the only travellers. In the
          coach from Bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg. He is well
          known to the conductor. Beyond that are the ordinary carriages, but
          these do not concern us, since they were locked after dinner had been
          served last night. Forward of the <nobr>Istanbul-Calais</nobr> coach
          there is only the <nobr>dining-car.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Then it seems,” said Poirot slowly, “as though we must look for our
          murderer in the <nobr>Istanbul-Calais</nobr> coach.” He turned to the
          doctor. “That is what you were hinting, I think?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The Greek nodded. “At half an hour after midnight we ran into the
          snowdrift. No one can have left the train since then.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">M. Bouc said solemnly, “</span>The murderer is with

        <p class="p158 ft11">A WOMAN</p>
        <p class="p159 ft3">
          “First of all,” said Poirot, “I should like a word or two with young
          Mr. MacQueen. He may be able to give us valuable information.”
        </p>
        <p class="p160 ft5">
          “Certainly,” said M. Bouc. He turned to the
          <span class="ft4">chef de train</span>. “Get Mr. MacQueen to come
          here.” The <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>left the carriage.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          The conductor returned with a bundle of passports and tickets. M. Bouc
          took them from him. “Thank you, Michel. It would be best now, I think,
          if you were to go back to your post. We
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">will take your evidence formally later.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Very good, Monsieur,” said Michel, and in his turn left the carriage.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “After we have seen young MacQueen,” said Poirot, “perhaps
          <span class="ft4">M. le docteur </span>will come with me to the dead
          man’s carriage.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Certainly.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“After we have finished <nobr>there—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          But at this moment the <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>returned
          with Hector MacQueen.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc rose. “We are a little cramped here,” he said pleasantly.
          “Take my seat, Mr. MacQueen. M. Poirot will sit opposite
          <nobr>you—so.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He turned to the <span class="ft22">chef de train</span>. “Clear all
          the people out of the restaurant car,” he said, “and let it be left
          free for M. Poirot. You will conduct your interviews there,
          <span class="ft22">mon cher</span>?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “It would be the most convenient, yes,” agreed Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          MacQueen had stood looking from one to the other, not quite following
          the rapid flow of French.
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          <nobr>“<span class="ft22">Qu’est-ce</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> qu’il y a</span>?” he began laboriously.
          <nobr>“<span class="ft22">Pourquoi</span>—?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          With a vigorous gesture Poirot motioned him to the seat in the corner.
          He took it and began once more.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          <nobr>“<span class="ft22">Pourquoi</span>—?”</nobr> Then checking
          himself and relapsing into his own tongue: “What’s up on the train?
          Has anything happened?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">He looked from one man to another.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot nodded. “Exactly. Something has happened. Prepare yourself for
          a shock.
          <span class="ft4">Your employer, M. Ratchett, is dead</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          MacQueen’s mouth pursed itself into a whistle. Except that his eyes
          grew a shade brighter, he showed no signs of shock or distress.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“So they got him after all,” he said.</p>
        <p class="p161 ft5">
          “What exactly do you mean by that phrase, Mr. MacQueen?” MacQueen
          hesitated.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You are assuming,” said Poirot, “that M. Ratchett was murdered?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Wasn’t he?” This time MacQueen did show surprise. “Why, yes,” he said
          slowly. “That’s just what I did think. Do you mean he just died in his
          sleep? Why, the old man was as tough as— as <nobr>tough—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">He stopped, at a loss for a simile.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, no,” said Poirot. “Your assumption was quite right. M. Ratchett
          was murdered. Stabbed. But I should like to know why you were so sure
          it <span class="ft22">was </span>murder, and not
          <nobr>just—death.”</nobr>

    <div id="page_30">
      <div id="id30_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          MacQueen hesitated. “I must get this clear,” he said. “Who exactly are
          you? And where do you come in?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I represent the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.” Poirot
          paused, then added, “I am a detective. My name is Hercule Poirot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          If he expected an effect he did not get one. MacQueen said merely,
          “Oh! yes?” and waited for him to go on.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You know the name perhaps?”</p>
        <p class="p162 ft5">
          “Why, it does seem kind of familiar. Only I always thought it was a
          woman’s dressmaker.” Hercule Poirot looked at him with distaste. “It
          is incredible!” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What’s incredible?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Nothing. Let us advance with the matter in hand. I want you to tell
          me, M. MacQueen, all that you know about the dead man. You were not
          related to him?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No. I <nobr>am—was—his</nobr> secretary.”</p>
        <p class="p163 ft5">
          “For how long have you held that post?” “Just over a year.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Please give me all the information you can.”</p>
        <p class="p85 ft3">
          “Well, I met Mr. Ratchett just over a year ago when I was in
          <nobr>Persia—”</nobr> Poirot interrupted.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“What were you doing there?’</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I had come over from New York to look into an oil concession. I don’t
          suppose you want to hear all about that. My friends and I had been let
          in rather badly over it. Mr. Ratchett was in the same hotel. He had
          just had a row with his secretary. He offered me the job and I took
          it. I was at a loose end and glad to find a <nobr>well-paid</nobr> job
          ready made, as it were.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And since then?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “We’ve travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was
          hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than as a
          secretary. It was a pleasant life.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Now tell me as much as you can about your employer.”
        </p>
        <p class="p164 ft5">
          The young man shrugged his shoulders. A perplexed expression passed
          over his face. “That’s not so easy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p165 ft3">
          “What was his full name?” “Samuel Edward Ratchett.” “He was an
          American citizen?” “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p166 ft3">
          “What part of America did he come from?” “I don’t know.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Well, tell me what you do know.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “The actual truth is, Mr. Poirot, that I know nothing at all! Mr.
          Ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in America.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Why do you think that was?”</p>
        <p class="p167 ft5">
          “I don’t know. I imagined that he might be ashamed of his beginnings.
          Some men are.” “Does that strike you as a satisfactory solution?”
        </p>
        <p class="p168 ft5">
          “Frankly, it doesn’t.” “Has he any relatives?” “He never mentioned
          any.” Poirot pressed the point.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You must have formed <span class="ft22">some </span>theory, Mr.
          MacQueen.”

      <div id="id31_1">
        <p class="p138 ft3">
          “Well, Yes, I did. For one thing, I don’t believe Ratchett was his
          real name. I think he left America definitely in order to escape
          someone or something. I think he was <nobr>successful—until</nobr> a
          few weeks ago.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“And then?”</p>
        <p class="p169 ft3">
          “He began to get <nobr>letters—threatening</nobr> letters.” “Did you
          see them?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes. It was my business to attend to his correspondence. The first
          letter came a fortnight ago.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“Were these letters destroyed?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, I think I’ve got a couple still in my <nobr>files—one</nobr> I
          know Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall I get them for you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“If you would be so good.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          MacQueen left the compartment. He returned a few minutes later and
          laid down two sheets of rather dirty notepaper before Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The first letter ran as follows:</p>
        <p class="p91 ft22">
          Thought you’d <nobr>double-cross</nobr> us and get away with it, did
          you? Not on your life. We’re out to GET you, Ratchett, and we WILL get
          you!
        </p>
        <p class="p170 ft3">There was no signature.</p>
        <p class="p171 ft3">
          With no comment beyond raised eyebrows, Poirot picked up the second
          letter.
        </p>
        <p class="p91 ft24">
          We’re going to take you for a ride, Ratchett. Some time soon. We’re
          going to GET you— see?
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">Poirot laid the letter down.</p>
        <p class="p172 ft3">
          “The style is monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.”
          MacQueen stared at him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You would not observe,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It requires the eye
          of one used to such things. This letter was not written by one person,
          M. MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it— each writing one letter of
          a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task
          of identifying the handwriting much more difficult.” He paused, then
          said: “Did you know that M. Ratchett had applied for help to me?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“To <span class="ft22">you</span>?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly that the young
          man had not known of
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">it.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act
          when he received the first letter?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">MacQueen hesitated.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It’s difficult to say. <nobr>He—he—passed</nobr> it off with a laugh
          in that quiet way of his. But <nobr>somehow—”</nobr> he gave a slight
          <nobr>shiver—“I</nobr> felt that there was a good deal going on
          underneath the quietness.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you
          regarded your employer? Did you like him?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.

    </div>
    <div id="page_32">
      <div id="id32_1">
        <p class="p173 ft3">“No,” he said at last. “I did not.” “Why.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.” He
          paused, then said: “I’ll tell you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I disliked
          and distrusted him. He was, I am sure, a cruel and dangerous man. I
          must admit, though, that I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One further question: when did you last see
          Mr. Ratchett alive?” “Last evening <nobr>about—”</nobr> he thought for
          a <nobr>minute—“ten</nobr> o’clock, I should say. I went into his
        </p>
        <p class="p174 ft3">
          compartment to take down some memoranda from him.” “On what subject?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in Persia. What had
          been delivered was not what he had purchased. There has been a long,
          vexatious correspondence on the subject.”
        </p>
        <p class="p175 ft3">
          “And that was the last time Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?” “Yes, I
          suppose so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p85 ft5">
          “Do you know when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?”
          “On the morning of the day we left Constantinople.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “There is one more question I must ask you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on
          good terms with your employer?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “This is where I’m supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In
          the words of a best seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I
          were on perfectly good terms.”
        </p>
        <p class="p176 ft3">
          “Perhaps, Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your
          address in America.” MacQueen gave his
          <nobr>name—Hector</nobr> Willard <nobr>MacQueen—and</nobr> an address
          in New York. Poirot leaned back against the cushions.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That is all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be
          obliged if you would keep the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to
          yourself for a little time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“His valet, Masterman, will have to know.”</p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “He probably knows already,” said Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him
          to hold his tongue.” “That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher
          and, as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’ He has
        </p>
        <p class="p177 ft5">
          a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at all of any other
          nationality.” “Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The American left the carriage.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “He seems honest and straightforward. He did not pretend to any
          affection for his employer, as he probably would have done had he been
          involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not tell him that he
          had tried to enlist my services and failed, but I do not think that
          that is really a suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr. Ratchett was a
          gentleman who kept his own counsel on every possible occasion.”
        </p>
        <p class="p178 ft3">
          “So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,” said M.
          Bouc jovially. Poirot cast on him a look of reproach.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Me, I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the
          same, I must admit that I cannot see this sober,
          <nobr>long-headed</nobr> MacQueen losing his head and stabbing his
          victim twelve or fourteen times. It is not in accord with his
          <nobr>psychology—not</nobr> at all.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the act of a man driven
          almost crazy with a frenzied <nobr>hate—it</nobr> suggests rather the
          Latin temperament. Or else it suggests, as our friend the
          <span class="ft22">chef de train </span
          ><nobr>insisted—a</nobr> woman.”

        <p class="p179 ft11">THE BODY</p>
        <p class="p118 ft3">
          Followed by Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his way to the next coach and
          to the compartment occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came
          and unlocked the door for them with his key.
        </p>
        <p class="p180 ft3">
          The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion.
          “How much has been disarranged in this compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p181 ft3">
          “Nothing has been touched. I was careful not to move the body in
          making my examination.” Poirot nodded. He looked round him.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold. The
          window was pushed down as far as it would go, and the blind was drawn
          up.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“<span class="ft22">Brrr</span>,” observed Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p182 ft5">
          The other smiled appreciatively. “I did not like to close it,” he
          said. Poirot examined the window carefully.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way.
          Possibly the open window was intended to suggest that somebody did;
          but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s intention.”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft23">
          He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case
          from his pocket he blew a little powder over the frame.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped.
          Well, if there had been fingerprints they would have told us very
          little. They would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or his valet or the
          conductor. Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And that being so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the
          window. Positively it is the cold storage in here!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the
          first time to the motionless figure lying in the bunk.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty
          patches, had been unbuttoned and thrown back.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “I had to see the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the
          doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself
          with a slight grimace. “It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have
          stood there and stabbed him again and again.
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">How many wounds are there exactly?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically
          scratches. On the other hand, at least three would be capable of
          causing death.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s attention. He looked at
          him sharply. The little Greek was standing staring down at the body
          with a puzzled frown.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently. “Speak,
          my friend. There is something here that puzzles you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p183 ft3">
          “You are right,” acknowledged the other. “What is it?”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id33_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_34">
      <div id="id34_1">
        <p class="p138 ft3">
          “You see these two <nobr>wounds—here</nobr> and <nobr>here—”</nobr> He
          pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must have severed blood
          <nobr>vessels—and</nobr> yet the edges do not gape. They have not bled
          as one would have expected.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Which suggests?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That the man was already <nobr>dead—some</nobr> little time
          <nobr>dead—when</nobr> they were delivered. But that is surely
          absurd.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer
          figured to himself that he had not accomplished his job properly and
          came back to make quite <nobr>sure—but</nobr> that is manifestly
          absurd! Anything else?”
        </p>
        <p class="p184 ft3">“Well, just one thing.” “And that?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You see this wound <nobr>here—under</nobr> the right
          <nobr>arm—near</nobr> the right shoulder. Take this pencil of mine.
          Could you deliver such a blow?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Poirot poised his hand.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Précisément</span>,” he said. “I see. With the
          <span class="ft22">right </span>hand it is exceedingly difficult,
          almost impossible. One would have to strike backhanded, as it were.
          But if the blow were struck with the <span class="ft22">left </span
          ><nobr>hand—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p185 ft3">
          “Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the
          <span class="ft22">left </span>hand.” “So that our murderer is
          <nobr>left-handed?</nobr> No, it is more difficult than that, is it
          not?” “As you say, M. Poirot. Some of these other blows are just as
          obviously <nobr>right-handed.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Two people. We are back at two people again,” murmured the detective.
          He asked abruptly: “Was the electric light on?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor
          every morning about ten o’clock.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">“The switches will tell us,” said Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He examined the switch of the top light and also the
          <nobr>roll-back</nobr> <nobr>bed-head</nobr> light. The former was
          turned off. The latter was closed.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Eh bien</span>,” he said thoughtfully. “We have
          here a hypothesis of the First and the Second Murderer, as the great
          Shakespeare would put it. The First Murderer stabbed his victim and
          left the compartment, turning off the light. The Second Murderer came
          in in the dark, did not see that his or her work had been done, and
          stabbed at least twice at a dead body. <span class="ft22">Que </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft22">pensez-vous</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> de ça</span>?”
        </p>
        <p class="p186 ft23">
          “Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm. The other’s
          eyes twinkled.
        </p>
        <p class="p187 ft5">
          “You think so? I am glad. It sounded to me a little like the
          nonsense.” “What other explanation can there be?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is just what I am asking myself. Have we here a coincidence, or
          what? Are there any other inconsistencies, such as would point to two
          people being concerned?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I think I can say yes. Some of these blows, as I have already said,
          point to a <nobr>weakness—a</nobr> lack of strength or a lack of
          determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here— and
          this <nobr>one—”</nobr> Again he pointed. “Great strength was needed
          for those blows. They have penetrated the muscle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p155 ft3">
          “They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?” “Most certainly.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“They could not have been delivered by a woman?”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id34_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_35">
      <div id="id35_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck them, especially
          if she were in the grip of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion
          highly unlikely.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot was silent a moment or two.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The matter begins to clear itself up
          wonderfully! The murderer was a man of great
          <nobr>strength—he</nobr> was <nobr>feeble—it</nobr> was a
          <nobr>woman—it</nobr> was a <nobr>right-handed</nobr>
          <nobr>person—it</nobr> was a <nobr>left-handed</nobr> person.
          <span class="ft4">Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça</span>!” He spoke with
          sudden anger. “And the victim— what does he do in all this? Does he
          cry out? Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol
          which Ratchett had shown him the day before.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Fully loaded, you see,” he said.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the
          hooks on the wall. On the small table formed by the lid of the wash
          basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of water. Another
          glass, empty. A bottle of mineral water. A large flask. An
          <nobr>ash-tray</nobr> containing the butt of a cigar and some charred
          fragments of paper; also two burnt matches.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it.
        </p>
        <p class="p188 ft3">
          “Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly.
          “Drugged?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p189 ft5">
          Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them
          carefully. “You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Those two matches are of different shapes,” said Poirot. “One is
          flatter than the other. You see?”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          “It is the kind you get on the train,” said the doctor. “In paper
          covers.”

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot was feeling in the pockets of Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he
          pulled out a box of matches. He compared them carefully with the burnt
          ones.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “The rounder one is a match struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us
          see if he had also the flatter kind.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">But a further search showed no other matches.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot’s eyes were darting about the compartment. They were bright and
          sharp like a bird’s. One felt that nothing could escape their
          scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          With a little exclamation he bent and <nobr>picked-up</nobr> something
          from the floor.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          It was a small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an
          embroidered <nobr>initial—H.</nobr> “A woman’s handkerchief,” said the
          doctor. “Our friend the <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>was
          right. There is a
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">woman concerned in this.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said
          Poirot. “Exactly as it happens in the books and on the
          <nobr>films—and</nobr> to make things even easier for us, it is marked
          with an initial.”
        </p>
        <p class="p190 ft3">
          “What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor. “Is it not?”
          said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask
          for elucidation Poirot had made another dive onto the floor.
        </p>
        <p class="p191 ft5">
          This time he held out on the palm of his <nobr>hand—a</nobr>
          <nobr>pipe-cleaner.</nobr> “It is perhaps the property of Mr.
          Ratchett?” suggested the doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p192 ft3">
          “There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco
          pouch.” “Then it is a clue.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id35_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_36">
      <div id="id36_1">
        <p class="p138 ft3">
          “Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue,
          this time, you note! One cannot complain of having no clues in this
          case. There are clues here in abundance. By the way, what have you
          done with the weapon?”
        </p>
        <p class="p79 ft5">
          “There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have taken it away
          with him.” “I wonder why,” mused Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p193 ft5">
          “Ah!” The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of
          the dead man. “I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket
          and threw it straight back.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case was
          dented savagely, and the hands pointed to a quarter past one.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the
          crime. It agrees with my calculations. Between midnight and two in the
          morning is what I said, and probably about one o’clock, though it is
          difficult to be exact in these matters.
          <span class="ft4">Eh bien</span>, here is confirmation. A quarter past
          one. That was the hour of the crime.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It is possible, yes. It is certainly possible.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will pardon me, M. Poirot,
          but I do not quite understand you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I do not understand myself,” said Poirot. “I understand nothing at
          all. And, as you perceive, it worries me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred
          fragment of paper. He murmured to himself, “What I need at this moment
          is an <nobr>old-fashioned</nobr> woman’s <nobr>hat-box.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular
          remark. In any case Poirot gave him no time for questions. Opening the
          door into the corridor, he called for the conductor.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The man arrived at a run.</p>
        <p class="p194 ft5">
          “How many women are there in this coach?” The conductor counted on his
          fingers.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “One, two, <nobr>three—six,</nobr> Monsieur. The old American lady, a
          Swedish lady, the young English lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and
          Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot considered.</p>
        <p class="p195 ft5">
          “They all have <nobr>hat-boxes,</nobr> yes?” “Yes, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Then bring <nobr>me—let</nobr> me <nobr>see—yes,</nobr> the Swedish
          lady’s and that of the <nobr>lady’s-maid.</nobr> Those two are the
          only hope. You will tell them it is a customs
          <nobr>regulation—something—anything</nobr> that occurs to you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p196 ft3">
          “That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither lady is in her compartment
          at the moment.” “Then be quick.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot
          opened that of the maid, and tossed it aside. Then he opened the
          Swedish lady’s and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. Removing
          the hats carefully, he disclosed round humps of
          <nobr>wire-netting.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen years ago
          <nobr>hat-boxes</nobr> were made like this. You skewered through the
          hat with a hatpin on to this hump of <nobr>wire-netting.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then
          he repacked the hat- box and told the conductor to return both boxes
          where they belonged.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon the expert
          procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the
          cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome a

          little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but
          can I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I do not quite understand you, M. Poirot.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, to give you an <nobr>example—we</nobr> find a woman’s
          handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or did a man, committing the crime,
          say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I will
          stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows
          feeble and ineffective, and I will drop this handkerchief where no one
          can miss it’? That is one possibility. Then there is another. Did a
          woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a
          <nobr>pipe-cleaner</nobr> to make it look like a man’s work? Or are we
          seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a woman, were
          separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to drop a clue
          to his or her identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence,
          that!”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          “But where does the <nobr>hat-box</nobr> come in?” asked the doctor,
          still puzzled.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these <nobr>clues—the</nobr> watch
          stopped at a quarter past one, the handkerchief, the
          <nobr>pipe-cleaner—they</nobr> may be genuine, or they may be faked.
          As to that I cannot yet tell. But there is one clue here
          <nobr>which—though</nobr> again I may be <nobr>wrong—I</nobr> believe
          has not been faked. I mean this flat match,
          <span class="ft4"
            >M. le docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer,
            not by Mr. Ratchett</span
          >. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind. Possibly a
          note. If so, there was something in that note, some mistake, some
          error, that left a possible clue to the assailant. I am going to try
          to discover what that something was.”
        </p>
        <p class="p198 ft23">
          He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a
          small spirit stove and a pair of <nobr>curling-tongs.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to the latter.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened out the
          two humps of wire, and with great care wriggled the charred scrap of
          paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on top of it and then,
          holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing over
          the flame of the <nobr>spirit-lamp.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let
          us hope that it will answer our purpose.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal began to
          glow. Suddenly he saw faint indications of letters. Words formed
          themselves <nobr>slowly-words</nobr> of fire.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed.
        </p>
        <p class="p199 ft22"><nobr>—member</nobr> little Daisy Armstrong</p>
        <p class="p200 ft3">
          “Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. “It tells you something?” asked
          the doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs carefully.
        </p>
        <p class="p83 ft4">
          <span class="ft5">“Yes,” he said. “</span>I know the dead man’s real
          name. I know why he had to leave America<span class="ft5"
            >.” “What was his name?”</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Cassetti.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Cassetti?” Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me
          something. Some years ago. I cannot remember. ... It was a case in
          America, was it not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Further than that Poirot was not disposed to be communicative. He
          looked round him as he went on:

          “We will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we
          have seen all there is to be seen here.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead
          man’s clothes but found nothing there of interest. He tried the
          communicating door which led through to the next compartment, but it
          was bolted on the other side.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “There is one thing that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine.
          “If the murderer did not escape through the window, and if this
          communicating door was bolted on the other side, and if the door into
          the corridor was not only locked on the inside but chained, how then
          did the murderer leave the compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That is what the audience says when a person bound hand and foot is
          shut into a cabinet— and disappears.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You <nobr>mean—?”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I mean,” explained Poirot, “that if the murderer intended us to
          believe that he had escaped by way of the window, he would naturally
          make it appear that the other two exits were impossible. Like the
          ‘disappearing person’ in the cabinet, it is a trick. It is our
          business to find out how the trick is done.

        <p class="p135 ft3">
          He locked the communicating door on their <nobr>side—“in</nobr> case,”
          he said, “the excellent Mrs. Hubbard should take it into her head to
          acquire <nobr>first-hand</nobr> details of the crime to write to her
          daughter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">He looked round once more.</p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">

          conduct his examination of the passengers there. In the meantime I
          have ordered them to bring us three some food here.”

        <p class="p5 ft3">“An excellent idea,” said Poirot.</p>

          None of the three men was hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not

        <p class="p5 ft3">“Who was he?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Do you remember reading of the Armstrong baby? This is the man who
          murdered little Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I recall it now. A shocking <nobr>affair—though</nobr> I cannot
          remember the details.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Colonel Armstrong was an <nobr>Englishman—a</nobr> V.C. He was half
          American, his mother having been a daughter of W. K. Van der Halt, the
          Wall Street millionaire. He married the daughter of Linda Arden, the
          most famous tragic American actress of her day. They lived in America
          and had one <nobr>child—a</nobr> girl whom they idolized. When she was
          three years old she was kidnapped, and an impossibly high sum demanded
          as the price of her return. I will not weary you with all the
          intricacies that followed. I will come to the moment when, after the
          parents had paid over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand
          dollars, the child’s dead body was discovered; it had been dead for at
          least a fortnight. Public indignation rose to fever point. And there
          was worse to follow. Mrs. Armstrong was expecting another baby.
          Following the shock of the discovery, she gave birth prematurely to a
          dead child, and herself died. Her <nobr>broken-hearted</nobr> husband
          shot himself.”
        </p>
        <p class="p203 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mon Dieu</span>, what a tragedy. I remember now,”
          said M. Bouc. “There was also another death, if I remember rightly?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes, an unfortunate French or Swiss nursemaid. The police were
          convinced that she had some knowledge of the crime. They refused to
          believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of despair the poor
          girl threw herself from a window and was killed. It was proved
          afterwards that she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in
          the crime.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It is not good to think of,” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “About six months later, this man Cassetti was arrested as the head of
          the gang who had kidnapped the child. They had used the same methods
          in the past. If the police seemed likely to get on their trail, they
          killed their prisoner, hid the body, and continued to extract as much
          money as possible before the crime was discovered.
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          “Now, I will make clear to you this, my friend. Cassetti was the man!
          But by means of the enormous wealth he had piled up, and owing to the
          secret hold he had over various persons, he was acquitted on some
          technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding that, he would have been lynched
          by the populace had he not been clever enough to give them the slip.

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Ah! quel animal</span>!” M. Bouc’s tone was
          redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret that he is
          <nobr>dead—not</nobr> at all!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“I agree with you.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Tout de même</span>, it is not necessary that he
          should be killed on the Orient Express. There are other places.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot smiled a little. He realised that M. Bouc was biased in the
          matter.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “The question we have now to ask ourselves is this,” he said. “Is this
          murder the work of some rival gang whom Cassetti had
          <nobr>double-crossed</nobr> in the past, or is it an act of private
          vengeance?”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of
          paper.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “If I am right in my assumption, then, the letter was burnt by the
          murderer. Why? Because it mentioned the name ‘Armstrong,’ which is the
          clue to the mystery.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Are there any members of the Armstrong family living?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That, unfortunately, I do not know. I think I remember reading of a
          younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and Dr.
          Constantine. M. Bouc brightened at the mention of the broken watch.
        </p>
        <p class="p204 ft5">
          “That seems to give us the time of the crime very exactly.” “Yes,”
          said Poirot. “It is very convenient.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          There was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the
          other two look at him curiously.
        </p>
        <p class="p146 ft3">
          “You say that you yourself heard Ratchett speak to the conductor at
          twenty minutes to one?” asked M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot related just what had occurred.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Well,” said M. Bouc, “that proves at least that
          <nobr>Cassetti—or</nobr> Ratchett, as I shall continue to call
          <nobr>him—was</nobr> certainly alive at twenty minutes to one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          <nobr>“Twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one, to be precise.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          ‘Then at twelve <nobr>thirty-seven,</nobr> to put it formally, Mr.
          Ratchett was alive. That is <span class="ft22">one </span>fact, at
          least.”
        </p>
        <p class="p205 ft3">
          Poirot did not reply. He sat looking thoughtfully in front of him.
          There was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant entered. “The
          restaurant car is free now, Monsieur,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“We will go there,” said M. Bouc, rising.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I may accompany you?” asked Constantine.</p>
        <p class="p206 ft5">
          “Certainly, my dear doctor. Unless M. Poirot has any objection?” “Not
          at all. Not at all,” said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          After a little politeness in the matter of
          <nobr>precedence—“<span class="ft22">Après</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> vous, </span

        <p class="p209 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE WAGON LIT CONDUCTOR</p>
        <p class="p202 ft3">In the restaurant car all was in readiness.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot and M. Bouc sat together on one side of a table. The doctor sat
          across the aisle.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          On the table in front of Poirot was a plan of the
          <nobr>Istanbul-Calais</nobr> coach with the names of the passengers
          marked in red ink. The passports and tickets were in a pile at one
          side. There was writing paper, ink, pen, and pencils.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Excellent,” said Poirot. “We can open our Court of Inquiry without
          more ado. First, I think, we should take the evidence of the Wagon Lit
          conductor. You probably know something about the man. What character
          has he? Is he a man on whose word you would place reliance?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I should say so, most assuredly. Pierre Michel has been employed by
          the company for over fifteen years. He is a
          <nobr>Frenchman—lives</nobr> near Calais. Thoroughly respectable and
          honest. Not, perhaps, remarkable for brains.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot nodded comprehendingly. “Good,” he said. “Let us see him.”

        <p class="p210 ft3">
          Pierre Michel had recovered some of his assurance, but he was still
          extremely nervous.
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          “I hope Monsieur will not think that there has been any negligence on
          my part,” he said anxiously, his eyes going from Poirot to M. Bouc.
          “It is a terrible thing that has happened. I hope Monsieur does not
          think that it reflects on me in any way?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Having soothed the man’s fears, Poirot began his questions. He first
          elicited Michel’s name and address, his length of service, and the
          length of time he had been on this particular route. These particulars
          he already knew, but the routine questions served to put the man at
          his ease.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And now,” went on Poirot, “let us come to the events of Last night.
          M. Ratchett retired to <nobr>bed—when?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Almost immediately after dinner, Monsieur. Actually before we left
          Belgrade. So he did on the previous night. He had directed me to make
          up the bed while he was at dinner, and I did so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Did anybody go into his compartment afterwards?”</p>
        <p class="p211 ft5">
          “His valet, Monsieur, and the young American gentleman, his
          secretary.” “Anyone else?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, Monsieur, not that I know of.”</p>

      <div id="id43_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">
          “Good. And that is the last you saw or heard of him?”
        </p>
        <p class="p96 ft3">
          “No, Monsieur. You forget he rang his bell about twenty to
          <nobr>one—soon</nobr> after we had stopped.” “What happened exactly?”
        </p>
        <p class="p212 ft5">
          “I knocked at the door, but he called out and said he had made a
          mistake.” “In English or in French?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“In French.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What were his words exactly?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">“</span>Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé<span

          >
        </p>
        <p class="p213 ft5">
          “Quite right,” said Poirot. “That is what I heard. And then you went
          away?” “Yes, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Did you go back to your seat?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “No, Monsieur, I went first to answer another bell that had just
          rung.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Now, Michel, I am going to ask you an important question. Where were
          you at a quarter past one?’
        </p>
        <p class="p214 ft3">
          “I, Monsieur? I was at my little seat at the
          <nobr>end—facing</nobr> up the corridor.” “You are sure?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Mais </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft4">oui</span>—at</nobr> <nobr>least—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I went into the next coach, the Athens coach, to speak to my
          colleague there. We spoke about the snow. That was at some time soon
          after one o’clock. I cannot say exactly.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And you <nobr>returned—when?”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “One of my bells rang, <nobr>Monsieur—I</nobr>
          <nobr>remember—I</nobr> told you. It was the American lady. She had
          rung several times.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I recollect,” said Poirot. “And after that?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “After that, Monsieur? I answered your bell and brought you some
          mineral water. Then, about half an hour later, I made up the bed in
          one of the other <nobr>compartments—that</nobr> of the young American
          gentleman, Mr. Ratchett’s secretary.”
        </p>
        <p class="p193 ft3">
          “Was Mr. MacQueen alone in his compartment when you went to make up
          his bed?” “The English Colonel from No. 15 was with him. They had been
          sitting talking.” “What did the Colonel do when he left Mr. MacQueen?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“He went back to his own compartment.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “No. <nobr>15—that</nobr> is quite close to your seat, is it not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p215 ft5">
          “Yes, Monsieur, it is the second compartment from that end of the
          corridor.” “His bed was already made up?”
        </p>
        <p class="p102 ft5">
          “Yes, Monsieur. I had made it up while he was at dinner.” “What time
          was all this?”
        </p>
        <p class="p216 ft3">
          “I could not say exactly, Monsieur. Not later than two o’clock
          certainly.” “And after that?”
        </p>
        <p class="p217 ft5">
          “After that, Monsieur, I sat in my seat till morning.” “You did not go
          again into the Athens coach?” “No, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Perhaps you slept?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I do not think so, Monsieur. The train being at a standstill
          prevented me from dozing off as I usually do.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Did you see any of the passengers moving up or down the corridor?”
        </p>
        <p class="p218 ft3">
          The man reflected. “One of the ladies went to the toilet at the far
          end, I think.” “Which lady?”
        </p>

    <div id="page_44">
      <div id="id44_1">
        <p class="p219 ft3">
          “I do not know, Monsieur. It was far down the corridor and she had her
          back to me. She had on a kimono of scarlet with dragons on it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p220 ft5">
          Poirot nodded. “And after that?” “Nothing, Monsieur, until the
          morning.” “You are sure?”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Ah, <nobr>pardon—you</nobr> yourself, Monsieur, opened your door and
          looked out for a second.” “Good, my friend,” said Poirot. “I wondered
          whether you would remember that. By the way, I
        </p>
        <p class="p221 ft3">
          was awakened by what sounded like something heavy falling against my
          door. Have you any idea what that could have been?”
        </p>
        <p class="p222 ft5">
          The man stared at him. “There was nothing, Monsieur. Nothing, I am
          positive of it.” “Then I must have had the
          <span class="ft4">cauchemar</span>,” said Poirot philosophically.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Unless,” put in M. Bouc, “it was something in the compartment next
          door that you heard.” Poirot took no notice of the suggestion. Perhaps
          he did not wish to before the Wagon Lit
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft5">conductor.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Let us pass to another point,” he said. “Supposing that last night an
          assassin joined the train. Is it quite certain that he could not have
          left it after committing the crime?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Pierre Michel shook his head.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Nor that he can be concealed on it somewhere?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “It has been well searched,” said M. Bouc. “Abandon that idea, my
          friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p223 ft5">
          “Besides,” said Michel, “no one could get on to the
          <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> without my seeing them.” “When was the last
          stop?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Vincovci.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What time was that?”</p>
        <p class="p224 ft5">
          “We should have left there at 11:58, but owing to the weather we were
          twenty minutes late.” “Someone might have come along from the ordinary
          part of the train?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “No, Monsieur. After the service of dinner, the door between the
          ordinary carriages and the <nobr>sleeping-cars</nobr> is locked.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Did you yourself descend from the train at Vincovci?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Yes, Monsieur. I got down onto the platform as usual and stood by the
          step up into the train. The other conductors did the same.”
        </p>
        <p class="p225 ft3">
          “What about the forward <nobr>door—the</nobr> one near the restaurant
          car?” “It is always fastened on the inside.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It is not so fastened now.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The man looked surprised; then his face cleared. “Doubtless one of the
          passengers opened it to look out on the snow.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Probably,” said Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p226 ft5">
          He tapped thoughtfully on the table for a minute or two. “Monsieur
          does not blame me?” said the man timidly. Poirot smiled on him kindly.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You have had the evil chance, my friend,” he said. “Ah! one other
          point while I remember it. You said that another bell rang just as you
          were knocking at M. Ratchett’s door. In fact I heard it myself Whose
          was it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p181 ft3">
          “It was the bell of Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff. She desired me to
          summon her maid.” “And you did so?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot studied the plan in front of him thoughtfully. Then he inclined
          his head.

        <p class="p5 ft3">The man rose. He looked at M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Do not distress yourself,” said the latter kindly; “I cannot see that

          For a minute or two Poirot remained lost, in thought.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I think,” he said at last, “that it would be well to have a further
          word with Mr. MacQueen, in view of what we now know.”
        </p>
        <p class="p183 ft3">
          The young American appeared promptly. “Well,” he said, “how are things
          going?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Not too badly. Since our last conversation, I have learnt
          <nobr>something—the</nobr> identity of Mr. Ratchett.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          Hector MacQueen leaned forward interestedly. “Yes?” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          <span class="ft3">“</span
          ><span class="ft26"
            >‘Ratchett,’ as you suspected, was merely an alias. The man
            ‘Ratchett’ was Cassetti, who ran the celebrated kidnapping </span
          ><nobr>stunts—including</nobr> the famous affair of little Daisy
          Armstrong.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          An expression of utter astonishment appeared on MacQueen’s face. Then
          it darkened. “The damned skunk!” he exclaimed.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You had no idea of this, Mr. MacQueen?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “No, sir,” said the young American decidedly. “If I had, I’d have cut
          off my right hand before it had a chance to do secretarial work for
          him!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You feel strongly about the matter, Mr. MacQueen?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I have a particular reason for doing so. My father was the district
          attorney who handled the case, Mr. Poirot. I saw Mrs. Armstrong more
          than <nobr>once—she</nobr> was a lovely woman. So gentle and
          heartbroken.” His face darkened. “If ever a man deserved what he got,
          <nobr>Ratchett—or</nobr> <nobr>Cassetti—is</nobr> the man. I’m
          rejoiced at his end. Such a man wasn’t fit to live!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You almost feel as though you would have been willing to do the good
          deed yourself?”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “I do. <nobr>I—”</nobr> He paused, then added rather guiltily, “Seems
          I’m kind of incriminating myself.” “I should be more inclined to
          suspect you, Mr. MacQueen, if you displayed an inordinate
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft5">sorrow at your employer’s decease.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I don’t think I could do that even to save myself from the chair,”
          said MacQueen grimly. Then he added: “If I’m not being unduly curious,
          just how did you figure this out? Cassetti’s identity, I mean.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          “By a fragment of a letter found in his compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p229 ft3">
          “But <nobr>surely—I</nobr> <nobr>mean—that</nobr> was rather careless
          of the old man?” “That depends,” said Poirot, “on the point of view.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          The young man seemed to find this remark rather baffling. He stared at
          Poirot as though trying to make him out.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “The task before me,” said Poirot, “is to make sure of the movements
          of every one on the train. No offence need be taken, you understand.
          It is only a matter of routine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Sure. Get right on with it and let me clear my character if I can.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I need hardly ask you the number of your compartment,” said Poirot,
          smiling, “since I shared it with you for a night. It is the
          <nobr>second-class</nobr> compartment Nos. 6 and 7, and after my
          departure you had it to yourself.”
        </p>

          “Now, Mr. MacQueen, I want you to describe your movements last night
          from the time of leaving the <nobr>dining-car.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That’s quite easy. I went back to my compartment, read a bit, got out
          on the platform at Belgrade, decided it was too cold, and got in
          again. I talked for a while to a young English lady who is in the
          compartment next to mine. Then I fell into conversation with that
          Englishman, Colonel <nobr>Arbuthnot—as</nobr> a matter of fact I think
          you passed us as we were talking. Then I went in to Mr. Ratchett and,
          as I told you, took down some memoranda of letters he wanted written.
          I said good tight to him and left him. Colonel Arbuthnot was still
          standing in the corridor. His compartment was already made up for the
          night, so I suggested that he should come along to mine. I ordered a
          couple of drinks and we got right down to it. Discussed world politics
          and the Government of India and our own troubles with Prohibition and
          the Wall Street crisis. I don’t as a rule cotton to
          <nobr>Britishers—they’re</nobr> a <nobr>stiff-necked</nobr>
          <nobr>lot—but</nobr> I liked this one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p230 ft3">
          “Do you know what time it was when he left you?” “Pretty late. Nearly
          two o’clock, I should say.” “You noticed that the train had stopped?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          ‘Oh, yes. We wondered a bit. Looked out and saw the snow lying very
          thick, but we didn’t think it was serious.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “What happened when Colonel Arbuthnot finally said good night?”
        </p>
        <p class="p231 ft5">
          “He went along to his compartment and I called to the conductor to
          make up my bed.” “Where were you whilst he was making it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p232 ft3">
          “Standing just outside the door in the corridor smoking a cigarette.”
          “And then?”
        </p>
        <p class="p233 ft5">
          “And then I went to bed and slept till morning.” “During the evening
          did you leave the train at all?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Arbuthnot and I thought we’d get out <nobr>at—what</nobr> was the
          name of the <nobr>place?—Vincovci—to</nobr> stretch our legs a bit.
          But it was bitterly <nobr>cold—a</nobr> blizzard on. We soon hopped
          back again.”
        </p>
        <p class="p234 ft3">
          “By which door did you leave the train?” “By the one nearest to our
          compartment.” “The one next to the <nobr>dining-car?”</nobr> “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p235 ft3">
          “Do you remember if it was bolted?” MacQueen considered.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Why, yes, I seem to remember it was. At least there was a kind of bar
          that fitted across the handle. Is that what you mean?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Yes. On getting back into the train did you replace that bar?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Why, <nobr>no—I</nobr> don’t think I did. I got in last. No, I don’t
          seem to remember doing so.” He added suddenly, “Is that an important
          point?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “It may be. Now, I presume, Monsieur, that while you and Colonel
          Arbuthnot were sitting talking the door of your compartment into the
          corridor was open?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Hector MacQueen nodded.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I want you, if you can, to tell me if anyone passed along that
          corridor <span class="ft4">after </span>the train left Vincovci up to
          the time you parted company for the night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">MacQueen drew his brows together.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I think the conductor passed along once,” he said, “coming from the
          direction of the dining- car. And a woman passed the other way, going
          towards it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Which woman?”</p>

          “I couldn’t say. I didn’t really notice. You see I was arguing a point
          with Arbuthnot. I just seem to remember a glimpse of some scarlet silk
          affair passing the door. I didn’t look, and anyway I wouldn’t have
          seen the person’s face. As you know, my carriage faces the
          <nobr>dining-car</nobr> end of the train, so a woman going along the
          corridor in that direction would have her back to me as soon as she’d
          passed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p236 ft3">
          Poirot nodded. “She was going to the toilet, I presume?” “I suppose
          so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And you saw her return?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, no, now that you mention it, I didn’t notice her returning but
          I suppose she must have done so.”

          not.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot paused a moment. “I think that is all at present. I should now
          like to see the valet of Mr. Ratchett. By the way, did both you and he
          always travel <nobr>second-class?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “He did. But I usually went <nobr>first—if</nobr> possible in the
          compartment adjoining Mr. Ratchett’s. Then he had most of his baggage
          put in my compartment and yet could get at both it and me easily
          whenever he chose. But on this occasion all the
          <nobr>first-class</nobr> berths were booked except the one that he
          took.”

        <p class="p244 ft5">
          “I went in to Mr. Ratchett as usual, sir, and attended to his wants.”
          “What were your duties exactly?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “To fold or hang up his clothes, sir, put his dental plate in water
          and see that he had everything he wanted for the night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p245 ft3">
          “Was his manner much the same as usual?” The valet considered a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p class="p246 ft5">
          “Well, sir, I think he was upset.” “In what <nobr>way—upset?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Over a letter he’d been reading. He asked me if it was I who had put
          it in his compartment. Of course I told him I hadn’t done any such
          thing, but he swore at me and found fault with everything I did.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Was that unusual?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Oh, no, sir. He lost his temper <nobr>easily—as</nobr> I say, it just
          depended what had happened to upset him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p247 ft23">
          “Did your master ever take a sleeping draught?” Dr. Constantine leaned
          forward a little.
        </p>
        <p class="p248 ft5">
          “Always when travelling by train, sir. He said he couldn’t sleep
          otherwise.” “Do you know what drug he was in the habit of taking?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I couldn’t say, I’m sure, sir. There was no name on the
          <nobr>bottle—just</nobr> ‘<span class="ft22"
            >The Sleeping Draught to be taken at bedtime</span
          >.’ ”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Did he take it last night?”</p>
        <p class="p103 ft3">
          “Yes, sir. I poured it into a glass and put it on top of the toilet
          table ready for him.” “You didn’t actually see him drink it?”

        <p class="p65 ft3">“No, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What happened next?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I asked if there was anything further, and also asked what time he
          would like to be called in the morning. He said he didn’t want to be
          disturbed till he rang.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Was that usual?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Quite usual, sir. When he was ready to get up he used to ring the
          bell for the conductor and then send him for me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Was he usually an early or a late riser?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It depended, sir, on his mood. Sometimes he’d get up for breakfast,
          sometimes he wouldn’t get up till just on lunch time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p249 ft3">
          “So that you weren’t alarmed when the morning wore on and no summons
          came?” “No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="p250 ft5">
          “Did you know that your master had enemies?” “Yes, sir.” The man spoke
          quite unemotionally. “How did you know?”
        </p>
        <p class="p251 ft3">
          “I had heard him discussing some letters, sir, with Mr. MacQueen.”
          “Had you an affection for your employer, Masterman?”
        </p>
        <p class="p222 ft5">
          Masterman’s face became, if possible, even more inexpressive than it
          was normally. “I should hardly like to say that, sir. He was a
          generous employer.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“But you didn’t like him?”</p>
        <p class="p74 ft5">
          “Shall we put it that I don’t care very much for Americans, sir?”
          “Have you ever been in America?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p215 ft5">
          “Do you remember reading in the paper of the Armstrong kidnapping
          case?” A little colour came into the man’s cheeks.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Yes, indeed, sir. A little baby girl, wasn’t it? A very shocking
          affair.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Did you know that your employer, Mr. Ratchett, was the principal
          instigator in that affair?” “No, indeed, sir.” The valet’s tone held
          positive warmth and feeling for the first time. “I can
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft5">hardly believe it, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Nevertheless, it is true. Now, to pass to your own movements last
          night. A matter of routine, you understand. What did you do after
          leaving your master?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I told Mr. MacQueen, sir, that the master wanted him. Then I went to
          my own compartment and read.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Your compartment <nobr>was—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p252 ft5">
          “The end <nobr>second-class</nobr> one, sir. Next to the
          <nobr>dining-car.”</nobr> Poirot was looking at his plan.
        </p>
        <p class="p253 ft3">
          “I <nobr>see—and</nobr> you had which berth?” “The lower one, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="p254 ft5">“That is No. 4?” “Yes, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p255 ft5">
          “Is there anyone in with you?” “Yes, sir. A big Italian fellow.” “Does
          he speak English?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Well, a kind of English, sir.” The valet’s tone was deprecating.
          “He’s been in America— Chicago, I understand.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Do you and he talk together much?”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id50_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_51">
      <div id="id51_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">“No, sir. I prefer to read.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Poirot smiled. He could visualize the <nobr>scene—the</nobr> large,
          voluble Italian, and the snub direct administered by the gentleman’s
          gentleman.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “And what, may I ask, are you reading?” he inquired.
        </p>
        <p class="p192 ft5">
          “At present, sir, I am reading
          <span class="ft4">Love’s Captive</span>, by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.”
          “A good story?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I find it highly enjoyable, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Well, let us continue. You returned to your compartment and read
          <span class="ft22">Love’s Captive </span>till— when?”
        </p>
        <p class="p256 ft23">
          “At about ten thirty, sir, this Italian wanted to go to bed. So the
          conductor came and made the beds up.”
        </p>
        <p class="p257 ft5">
          “And then you went to bed and to sleep?” “I went to bed, sir, but I
          didn’t sleep.” “Why didn’t you sleep?”
        </p>
        <p class="p258 ft5">
          “I had the toothache, sir.” “Oh, <nobr>là-là—that</nobr> is painful.”
          “Most painful, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">“Did you do anything for it?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I applied a little oil of cloves, sir, which relieved the pain a
          little, but I was still not able to get to sleep. I turned the light
          on above my head and continued to <nobr>read—to</nobr> take my mind
          off, as it were.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">“And did you not go to sleep at all?”</p>
        <p class="p233 ft3">
          “Yes, sir, I dropped off about four in the morning.” “And your
          companion?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“The Italian fellow? Oh, he just snored.”</p>
        <p class="p259 ft5">
          “He did not leave the compartment at all during the night?” “No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="p260 ft3">“Did you?” “No, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Did you hear anything during the night?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I don’t think so, sir. Nothing unusual, I mean. The train being at a
          standstill made it all very quiet.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          Poirot was silent a moment or two. Then he spoke.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Well, I think there is very little more to be said. You cannot throw
          any light upon the tragedy?”
        </p>
        <p class="p69 ft3">“I’m afraid not. I’m sorry, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “As far as you know, was there any quarrel or bad blood between your
          master and Mr. MacQueen?”
        </p>
        <p class="p76 ft5">
          “Oh! no, sir. Mr. MacQueen was a very pleasant gentleman.” “Where were
          you in service before you came to Mr. Ratchett?” “With Sir Henry
          Tomlinson, sir, in Grosvenor Square.” “Why did you leave him?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “He was going to East Africa, sir, and did not require my services any
          longer. But I am sure he will speak for me, sir. I was with him some
          years.”
        </p>
        <p class="p261 ft3">
          “And you have been with Mr. <nobr>Ratchett—how</nobr> long?” “Just
          over nine months, sir.”

        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Thank you, that will do.”</p>
        <p class="p253 ft5">
          Poirot gave him a nod of dismissal. The valet hesitated a moment.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You’ll excuse me, sir, but the elderly American lady is in what I
          might describe as a state, sir. She’s saying she knows all about the
          murderer. She’s in a very excitable condition, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “In that case,” said Poirot, smiling, “we had better see her next.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Shall I tell her, sir? She’s been demanding to see someone in
          authority for a long time. The conductor’s been trying to pacify her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Send her to us, my friend,” said Poirot. “We will listen to her story

          Mrs. Hubbard arrived in the <nobr>dining-car</nobr> in such a state of
          breathless excitement that she was hardly able to articulate her
          words.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Now just tell me <nobr>this—who’s</nobr> in authority here? I’ve got
          some very important information,
          <span class="ft4">very </span>important indeed, and I’m going to tell
          it to someone in authority just as soon as I can. If you
          <nobr>gentlemen—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p264 ft3">
          Her wavering glance fluctuated between the three men. Poirot leaned
          forward. “Tell it to me, Madame,” he said. “But first, pray be
          seated.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Mrs. Hubbard plumped heavily down on to the seat opposite to him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “What I’ve got to tell you is just this. There was a murder on the
          train last night, and the murderer was
          <span class="ft4">right there in my compartment</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p265 ft3">
          She paused to give dramatic emphasis to her words. “You are sure of
          this, Madame?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Of course I’m sure! The idea! I know what I’m talking about. I’ll
          tell you everything there is to tell. I’d gotten into bed and gone to
          sleep, and suddenly I woke <nobr>up—everything</nobr> was dark— and I
          knew there was a man in my compartment. I was just so scared I
          couldn’t scream, if you know what I mean. I just lay there and
          thought, ‘Mercy, I’m going to be killed!’ I just can’t describe to you
          how I felt. These nasty trains, I thought, and all the outrages I’d
          read of. And I thought, ‘Well, anyway, he won’t get my
          <nobr>jewellery’—because,</nobr> you see, I’d put that in a stocking
          and hidden it under my <nobr>pillow—which</nobr> isn’t any too
          comfortable, by the way; kinda bumpy, if you know what I mean. But
          that’s neither here nor there. Where was I?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You realised, Madame, that there was a man in your compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes, well, I just lay there with my eyes closed, and wondered what
          I’d do. And I thought, well, I’m just thankful that my daughter
          doesn’t know the plight I’m in. And then, somehow, I got my wits about
          me and I felt about with my hand and I pressed the bell for the
          conductor. I pressed it and I pressed it, but nothing
          <nobr>happened—and</nobr> I can tell you, I thought my heart was going
          to stop beating. ‘Mercy,’ I said to myself, ‘maybe they’ve murdered
          every single soul on the train.’ It was at a standstill anyhow and
          there was a nasty quiet feel in the air. But I just went on pressing
          that bell and oh! the relief when I heard footsteps coming running
          down the corridor and a knock on the door! ‘Come in,’ I screamed, and
          I switched on the lights at the same time. And would you believe it,
          there wasn’t a <span class="ft22">soul </span>there!”
        </p>
        <p class="p266 ft3">
          This seemed to Mrs. Hubbard to be a dramatic climax rather than an
          anticlimax. “And what happened next, Madame?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Why, I told the man what had happened and he didn’t seem to believe
          me. Seemed to imagine I’d dreamed the whole thing. I made him look
          under the seat, though he said there wasn’t room for a man to squeeze
          himself in there. It was plain enough that the man had got
          <nobr>away—but</nobr> there <span class="ft4">had </span>been a man
          there, and it just made me mad the way the conductor tried to soothe
          me down! I’m not one to imagine things, <nobr>Mr.—I</nobr> don’t think
          I know your name?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Poirot, Madame; and this is M. Bouc, a director of the company, and
          Dr. Constantine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Mrs. Hubbard murmured, “Pleased to meet you, I’m sure,” to all three
          of them in an abstracted manner and then plunged once more into her
          recital.

          “Now I’m just not going to pretend I was as bright as I might have
          been. I got it into my head that it was the man from next
          <nobr>door—the</nobr> poor fellow who’s been killed. I told the
          conductor to look at the door between the compartments, and sure
          enough it wasn’t bolted. Well, I soon saw to that. I told him to bolt
          it then and there, and after he’d gone out I got up and put a suitcase
          against it to make sure.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“What time was this, Mrs. Hubbard?”</p>
        <p class="p267 ft3">
          “Well, I’m sure I can’t tell you. I never looked to see. I was so
          upset.” “And what is your theory now?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Why, I should say it was just as plain as plain could be. The man in
          my compartment was the murderer. Who else could he be?”
        </p>
        <p class="p268 ft5">
          “And you think he went back into the adjoining compartment?” “How do I
          know where he went? I had my eyes tight shut.” “He might have slipped
          out through the door into the corridor.” “Well, I couldn’t say. You
          see, I had my eyes tight shut.” Mrs. Hubbard sighed convulsively.

        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, I do not, <nobr>Mr.—what</nobr> is <nobr>it?—Poirot.</nobr> The
          man was
          <span class="ft4">right there in the same compartment with me</span>.
          And what’s more I’ve got proof of it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          Triumphantly, she hauled a large handbag into view and proceeded to
          burrow in its interior. She took out in turn two large clean
          handkerchiefs, a pair of <nobr>horn-rimmed</nobr> glasses, a bottle of
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft3">
          aspirin, a packet of Glauber’s Salts, a celluloid tube of bright green
          peppermints, a bunch of keys, a pair of scissors, a book of American
          Express cheques, a snapshot of an extraordinarily
          <nobr>plain-looking</nobr> child, some letters, five strings of
          <nobr>pseudo-Oriental</nobr> beads, and a small metal
          <nobr>object—a</nobr> button.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “You see this button? Well, it’s not one of
          <span class="ft22">my </span>buttons. It’s not off anything I’ve got.
          I found it this morning when I got up.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          As she placed it on the table, M. Bouc. leaned forward and gave an
          exclamation. “But this is a button from the tunic of a Wagon Lit
          attendant!”
        </p>
        <p class="p134 ft3">
          “There way be a natural explanation for that,” said Poirot. He turned
          gently to the lady.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “This button, Madame, may have dropped from the conductor’s uniform,
          either when he searched your cabin or when he was making the bed up
          last night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I just don’t know what’s the matter with all you people. Seems as
          though you don’t want to do anything but make objections. Now listen
          here. I was reading a magazine last night before I went to sleep.
          Before I turned the light out, I placed that magazine on a little case
          that was standing on the floor near the window. Have you got that?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">They assured her that they had.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Very well then. The conductor looked under the seat from near the
          door, and then he came in and bolted the door between me and the next
          compartment, but he never went near the window. Well, this morning
          that button was lying right on top of the magazine. What do you call
          that, I should like to know?”
        </p>
        <p class="p269 ft5">
          “That, Madame, I call evidence,” said Poirot. The answer seemed to
          appease the lady.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It makes me madder than a hornet to be disbelieved,” she explained.
        </p>

    <div id="page_55">
      <div id="id55_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “You have given us most interesting and valuable evidence,” said
          Poirot soothingly. “Now may I ask you a few questions?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why, certainly.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “How was it, since you were nervous of this man Ratchett, that you
          hadn’t already bolted the door between the compartments?”
        </p>
        <p class="p270 ft3">
          “I had,” returned Mrs. Hubbard promptly. “Oh, you had?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, as a matter of fact I asked that Swedish
          <nobr>creature—a</nobr> pleasant <nobr>soul—if</nobr> it was bolted,
          and she said it was.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“How was it you couldn’t see for yourself?”</p>
        <p class="p271 ft5">
          “Because I was in bed and my spongebag was hanging on the
          <nobr>door-handle.”</nobr> “What time was it when you asked her to do
          this for you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Now let me think. It must have- been round about
          <nobr>half-past</nobr> ten or a quarter to eleven. She’d come along to
          see if I had an aspirin. I told her where to find it and she got it
          out of my grip.”
        </p>
        <p class="p272 ft5">“You yourself were in bed?” “Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Suddenly she laughed. “Poor <nobr>soul—she</nobr> was so upset! You
          see, she’d opened the door of the next compartment by mistake.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Mr. Ratchett’s?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes. You know how difficult it is as you come along the train and all
          the doors are shut. She opened his by mistake. She was very distressed
          about it. He’d laughed, it seemed, and I guess he said something not
          quite nice. Poor thing, she certainly was upset. ‘Oh! I make mistake,’
          she said. ‘I ashamed make mistake. Not nice man,’ she said. ‘He say,
          “You too old.” ’ ”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Dr. Constantine sniggered, and Mrs. Hubbard immediately froze him with
          a glance.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “He wasn’t a nice kind of man,” she said, “to say a thing like that to
          a lady. It’s not right to laugh at such things.” Dr. Constantine
          hastily apologised.
        </p>
        <p class="p273 ft5">
          “Did you hear any noise from Mr. Ratchett’s compartment after that?”
          asked Poirot. <nobr>“Well—not</nobr> exactly.”
        </p>
        <p class="p274 ft5">
          “What do you mean by that, Madame?” <nobr>“Well—”</nobr> She paused.
          “He snored.” <nobr>“Ah!—he</nobr> snored, did he?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Terribly. The night before, it kept me awake.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You didn’t hear him snore after you had had the scare about a man
          being in your compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p275 ft3">
          “Why, Mr. Poirot, how could I? He was dead.” “Ah, Yes, truly,” said
          Poirot. He appeared confused.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Do you remember the affair of the Armstrong kidnap ping, Mrs.
          Hubbard?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes, indeed I do. And how the wretch that did it escaped
          <nobr>scot-free!</nobr> My, I’d have liked to get my hands on him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “He has not escaped. He is dead. He died last night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p276 ft5">
          “You don’t <nobr>mean—?’</nobr> Mrs. Hubbard half rose from her chair
          in excitement. “But yes, I do. Ratchett was the man.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Well</span>! Well, to think of that! I must write
          and tell my daughter. Now, didn’t I tell you last night that that man
          had an evil face? I was right, you see. My daughter always says: ‘When
          Mamma’s got a hunch you can bet your bottom dollar it’s O.K.’ ”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          “Were you acquainted with any of the Armstrong family, Mrs. Hubbard?”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id55_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_56">
      <div id="id56_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “No. They moved in a very exclusive circle. But I’ve always heard that
          Mrs. Armstrong was a perfectly lovely woman and that her husband
          worshipped her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well, Mrs. Hubbard, you have helped us very
          <nobr>much—very</nobr> much indeed. Perhaps you will give me your full
          name?”
        </p>
        <p class="p277 ft5">
          “Why, certainly. Caroline Martha Hubbard.” “Will you write your
          address down here?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Mrs. Hubbard did so, without ceasing to speak. “I just can’t get over
          it. <nobr>Cassetti—on</nobr> this train. I had a hunch about that man,
          didn’t I, Mr. Poirot?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Yes, indeed, Madame. By the way, have you a scarlet silk
          <nobr>dressing-gown?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Mercy, what a funny question! Why, no. I’ve got two
          <nobr>dressing-gowns</nobr> with <nobr>me—a</nobr> pink flannel one
          that’s kind of cosy for on board ship, and one my daughter gave me as
          a <nobr>present—a</nobr> kind of local affair in purple silk. But what
          in creation do you want to know about my dressing- gowns for?”
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “Well, you see, Madame, someone in a scarlet kimono entered either
          your or Mr. Ratchett’s compartment last night. It is, as you said just
          now, very difficult when all the doors are shut to know which
          compartment is which.”
        </p>
        <p class="p278 ft3">
          “Well, no one in a scarlet <nobr>dressing-gown</nobr> came into my
          compartment.” “Then she must have gone into Mr. Ratchett’s.”
        </p>
        <p class="p112 ft5">
          Mrs. Hubbard pursed her lips together and said grimly: “That wouldn’t
          surprise me any.” Poirot leaned forward. “So you heard a woman’s voice
          next door?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I don’t know how you guessed that, Mr. Poirot. I don’t really.
          <nobr>But—well—as</nobr> a matter of fact, I
          <span class="ft4">did</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But when I asked you just now if you heard anything next door, you
          only said you heard Mr. Ratchett snoring.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, that was true enough. He <span class="ft4">did </span>snore
          part of the time. As for the <nobr>other—”</nobr> Mrs. Hubbard got
          rather embarrassed. “It isn’t a very nice thing to speak about.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What time was it when you heard a woman’s voice?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I can’t tell you. I just woke up for a minute and heard a woman
          talking, and it was plain enough where she was. So I just thought,
          ‘Well, <span class="ft4">that’s </span>the kind of man he is! I’m not
          <nobr>surprised’—and</nobr> then I went to sleep again. And I’m sure I
          should never have mentioned anything of the kind to three strange
          gentlemen if you hadn’t dragged it out of me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Was it before the scare about the man in your compartment, or after?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Why, that’s like what you said just now! He wouldn’t have had a woman
          talking to him if he were dead, would he?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Pardon</span>. You must think me very stupid,
          Madame.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I guess even you get kinda muddled now and then. I just can’t get
          over its being that monster Cassetti. What my daughter will
          <nobr>say—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot managed adroitly to help the good lady to replace the contents
          of her handbag, and he then shepherded her towards the door.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">At the last moment, he said:</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame.”</p>
        <p class="p172 ft5">
          Mrs. Hubbard looked at the little scrap of cambric he held out to her.
          “That’s not mine, Mr. Poirot. I’ve got mine right here.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Pardon</span>. I thought as it had the initial H
          on <nobr>it—”</nobr>

          “Well, now, that’s funny, but it’s certainly not mine. Mine are marked
          C.M.H., and they’re sensible <nobr>things—not</nobr> expensive Paris
          fallals. What good is a handkerchief like that to anybody’s nose?”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          None of the three men seemed to have an answer to this question and
          Mrs. Hubbard sailed out triumphantly.

        <p class="p279 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE SWEDISH LADY</p>
        <p class="p202 ft3">
          M. Bouc was handling the button that Mrs. Hubbard had left behind her.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “This button. I cannot understand it. Does it mean that after all,
          Pierre Michel is involved in some way?” he asked. He paused, then
          continued, as Poirot did not reply. “What have you to say, my friend?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That button, it suggests possibilities,” said Poirot thoughtfully.
          “Let us interview next the Swedish lady before we discuss the evidence
          that we have heard.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He sorted through the pile of passports in front of him. “Ah! here we
          are. Greta Ohlsson, age <nobr>forty-nine.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc gave directions to the restaurant attendant, and presently the
          lady with the yellowish grey bun of hair and the long, mild,
          <nobr>sheep-like</nobr> face was ushered in. She peered
          <nobr>short-sightedly</nobr> at Poirot through her glasses, but was
          quite calm.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          It transpired that she understood and spoke French, so the
          conversation took place in that language. Poirot first asked her the
          questions to which he already knew the <nobr>answers—her</nobr> name,
          age, and address. He then asked her her occupation.
        </p>
        <p class="p96 ft3">
          She was, she told him, matron in a missionary school near Stamboul.
          She was a trained nurse. “You know, of course, of what took place last
          night, Mademoiselle?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Naturally. It is very dreadful. And the American lady tells me that
          the murderer was actually in her compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “I hear, Mademoiselle, that you were the last person to see the
          murdered man alive?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I do not know. It may be so. I opened the door of his compartment by
          mistake. I was much ashamed. It was a most awkward mistake.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You actually saw him?”</p>
        <p class="p280 ft5">
          “Yes. He was reading a book. I apologised quickly and withdrew.” “Did
          he say anything to you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">A slight flush showed on the worthy lady’s cheek.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “He laughed and said a few words. <nobr>I—I</nobr> did not quite catch
          them.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “And what did you do after that, Mademoiselle?” asked Poirot, passing
          from the subject tactfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p146 ft3">
          “I went in to the American lady, Mrs. Hubbard. I asked her for some
          aspirin and she gave it to me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p281 ft3">
          “Did she ask you whether the communicating door between her
          compartment and that of Mr. Ratchett was bolted?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p282 ft5">“And was it?” “Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And after that?”</p>
        <p class="p283 ft5">
          “After that I went back to my compartment, took the aspirin, and lay
          down.” “What time was all this?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “When I got into bed it was five minutes to eleven. I know because I
          looked at my watch before I wound it up.”

        <p class="p284 ft3">
          “Not very quickly. My head got better, but I lay awake some time.”
          “Had the train come to a stop before you went to sleep?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I do not think so. We stopped, I think, at a station just as I was
          getting drowsy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “That would be Vincovci. Now your compartment, Mademoiselle, is this
          one?” He indicated it on the plan.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That is so, yes.”</p>
        <p class="p285 ft5">
          “You had the upper or the lower berth?” “The lower berth, No. 10.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And you had a companion?’</p>
        <p class="p286 ft5">
          “Yes, a young English lady. Very nice, very amiable. She had travelled
          from Baghdad.” “After the train left Vincovci, did she leave the
          compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, I am sure she did not.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why are you sure if you were asleep?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I sleep very lightly. I am used to waking at a sound. I am sure that
          if she had come down from the berth above I should have awakened.”
        </p>
        <p class="p245 ft3">
          “Did you yourself leave the compartment?” “Not until this morning.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Have you a scarlet silk kimono, Mademoiselle?”</p>
        <p class="p287 ft5">
          “No, indeed. I have a good comfortable <nobr>dressing-gown</nobr> of
          Jaeger material.” “And the lady with you, Miss Debenham? What colour
          is her <nobr>dressing-gown?’</nobr> “A pale mauve aba such as you buy
          in the East.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot nodded. Then he asked in a friendly tone: “Why are you taking
          this journey? A holiday?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft23">
          “Yes, I am going home for a holiday. But first I am going to Lausanne
          to stay with a sister for a week or so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p288 ft5">
          “Perhaps you will be so amiable as to write me down the name and
          address of your sister?’ “With pleasure.”
        </p>
        <p class="p289 ft5">
          She took the paper and pencil he gave her and wrote down the name and
          address as requested. “Have you ever been in America, Mademoiselle?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No. I very nearly went once. I was to go with an invalid lady, but
          the plan was cancelled at the last moment. I much regretted this. They
          are very good, the Americans. They give much money to found schools
          and hospitals. And they are very practical.”
        </p>
        <p class="p74 ft5">
          “Do you remember hearing of the Armstrong kidnapping case?” “No, what
          was that?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot explained.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          Greta Ohlsson was indignant. Her yellow bun of hair quivered with her
          emotion.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “That there are in the world such evil men! It tries one’s faith. The

        <p class="p103 ft3">
          The amiable Swede departed, her kindly face flushed, her eyes suffused
          with tears. Poirot was writing busily on a sheet of paper.

        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “What is it you write there, my friend?” asked M. Bouc.

        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, it seems all quite clear and aboveboard. It seems quite plain
          that the crime was committed at 1.15. The evidence of the watch shows
          us that, and Mrs. Hubbard’s story fits in. For my mind, I will make a
          guess at the identity of the murderer. I say, my friend, that it is
          the big Italian. He comes from <nobr>America—from</nobr>
          <nobr>Chicago—and</nobr> remember an Italian’s weapon is the knife,
          and he stabs not once but several times.”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">“That is true.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Without a doubt, that is the solution of the mystery. Doubtless he
          and this Ratchett were in this kidnapping business together. Cassetti
          is an Italian name. In some way Ratchett did on him what they call the
          <nobr>double-cross.</nobr> The Italian tracks him down, sends him
          warning letters first, and finally revenges himself upon him in a
          brutal way. It is all quite simple.”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">Poirot shook his head doubtfully.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It is hardly so simple as that, I fear,” he murmured.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Me, I am convinced it is the truth,” said M. Bouc, becoming more and
          more enamoured of his theory.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And what about the valet with the toothache who swears that the
          Italian never left the compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p292 ft5">“That is the difficulty.” Poirot twinkled.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Yes, it is annoying, that. Unlucky for your theory, and extremely
          lucky for our Italian friend that M. Ratchett’s valet should have had
          the toothache.”
        </p>
        <p class="p229 ft3">
          “It will be explained,” said M. Bouc with magnificent certainty.

          “Let us hear what Pierre Michel has to say about this button,” he
          said. The Wagon Lit conductor was recalled. He looked at them
          inquiringly. M. Bouc cleared his throat.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Michel,” he said, “here is a button from your tunic. It was found in
          the American lady’s compartment. What have you to say for yourself
          about it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The conductor’s hand went automatically to his tunic. “I have lost no
          button, Monsieur,” he said. “There must be some mistake.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That is very odd.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I cannot account for it, Monsieur.” The man seemed astonished, but
          not in any way guilty or confused.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc said meaningly: “Owing to the circumstances in which it was
          found, it seems fairly certain that this button was dropped by the man
          who was in Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment last night when she rang the
          bell.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “But, Monsieur, there was no one there. The lady must have imagined
          it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “She did not imagine it, Michel. The assassin of M. Ratchett passed
          that <nobr>way—<span class="ft22">and</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> dropped that button</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          As the significance of M. Bouc’s words became plain to him, Pierre
          Michel flew into a violent state of agitation.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is not true, Monsieur; it is not true!” he cried. “You are
          accusing me of the crime. Me, I am innocent. I am absolutely innocent!
          Why should I want to kill a Monsieur whom I have never seen before?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Where were you when Mrs. Hubbard’s bell rang?”</p>
        <p class="p295 ft3">
          “I told you, Monsieur, in the next coach talking to my colleague.” “We
          will send for him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Do so, Monsieur, I implore you, do so.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The conductor of the next coach was summoned. He immediately confirmed
          Pierre Michel’s statement. He added that the conductor from the
          Bucharest coach had also been there. The three of them had been
          discussing the situation caused by the snow. They had been talking
          some ten minutes when Michel fancied he heard a bell. As he opened the
          doors connecting the two coaches, they had all heard it
          <nobr>plainly—a</nobr> bell ringing repeatedly. Michel had run
          <nobr>post-haste</nobr> to answer it.
        </p>
        <p class="p296 ft3">
          “So you see, Monsieur, I am not guilty,” cried Michel anxiously. “And
          this button from a Wagon Lit tunic, how do you explain it?” “I cannot,
          Monsieur. It is a mystery to me. All my buttons are intact.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Both of the other conductors also declared that they had not lost a
          button; also that they had not been inside Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment
          at any time.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Calm yourself, Michel,” said M. Bouc, “and cast your mind back to the
          moment when you ran to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s bell. Did you meet anyone
          at all in the corridor?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Did you see anyone going away from you down the corridor in the other
          direction?”

      <div id="id62_1">
        <p class="p297 ft3">“Again, no, Monsieur.” “Odd,” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Not so very,” said Poirot. “It is a question of time. Mrs. Hubbard
          wakes to find someone in her compartment. For a minute or two she lies
          paralysed, her eyes shut. Probably it was then that the man slipped
          out into the corridor. Then she starts ringing the bell. But the
          conductor does not come at once. It is only the third or fourth peal
          that he hears. I should say myself that there was ample
          <nobr>time—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p298 ft23">
          “For what? For what, <span class="ft24">mon cher</span>! Remember,
          there are thick drifts of snow all round the train.” “There are two
          courses open to our mysterious assassin,” said Poirot slowly. “He
          could retreat
        </p>
        <p class="p299 ft5">
          into either of the toilets <nobr>or—he</nobr> could disappear into one
          of the compartments.” “But they were all occupied.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p97 ft5">
          “You mean that he could retreat into his
          <span class="ft4">own </span>compartment?” Poirot nodded.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It <nobr>fits—it</nobr> fits;’ murmured M. Bouc. “During that ten
          minutes’ absence of the conductor, the murderer comes from his own
          compartment, goes into Ratchett’s, kills him, locks and chains the
          door on the inside, goes out through Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment, and
          is back safely in his own compartment by the time the conductor
          arrives.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot murmured: “It is not quite so simple as that, my friend. Our
          friend the doctor here will tell you so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          With a gesture M. Bouc signified that the three conductors might
          depart.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “We have still to see eight passengers,” said Poirot. “Five
          <nobr>first-class</nobr> <nobr>passengers—Princess</nobr> Dragomiroff,
          Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, and Mr. Hardman. Three
          <nobr>second-class</nobr> <nobr>passengers—Miss</nobr> Debenham,
          Antonio Foscarelli, and the <nobr>lady’s-maid,</nobr> Fräulein
          Schmidt.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Whom will you see <nobr>first—the</nobr> Italian?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “How you harp on your Italian! No, we will start at the top of the
          tree. Perhaps Madame la Princesse will be so good as to spare us a few
          moments of her time. Convey that message to her, Michel.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Oui, Monsieur</span>,” said the conductor, who was
          just leaving the car.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Tell her we can wait on her in her compartment if she does not wish
          to put herself to the trouble of coming here,” called M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          But Princess Dragomiroff declined to take this course. She appeared in
          the <nobr>dining-car,</nobr> inclined her head slightly and sat down
          opposite Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Her small <nobr>toad-like</nobr> face looked even yellower than the
          day before. She was certainly ugly, and yet, like the toad, she had
          eyes like jewels, dark and imperious, revealing latent energy and an
          intellectual force that could be felt at once.
        </p>
        <p class="p284 ft3">
          Her voice was deep, very distinct, with a slight grating quality in
          it. She cut short a flowery phrase of apology from M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “You need not offer apologies, Messieurs. I understand a murder has
          taken place. Naturally you must interview all the passengers. I shall
          be glad to give you all the assistance in my power.”
        </p>
        <p class="p300 ft3">
          “You are most amiable, Madame,” said Poirot. “Not at all. It is a
          duty. What do you wish to know?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Your full Christian names and address, Madame. Perhaps you would
          prefer to write them yourself?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot proffered a sheet of paper and pencil, but the Princess waved
          them aside.

          “Willingly. I directed the conductor to make up my bed whilst I was in
          the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> I retired to bed immediately after
          dinner. I read until the hour of eleven, when I turned out my light. I
          was unable to sleep owing to certain rheumatic pains from which I
          suffer. At about a quarter to one I rang for my maid. She massaged me
          and then read aloud till I felt sleepy. I cannot say exactly, when she
          left me. It may have been half an hour afterward, it may have been
          later.”

          Madame?” “I heard nothing unusual.”
        </p>
        <p class="p302 ft5">“What is your maids name?” “Hildegarde Schmidt.”</p>
        <p class="p303 ft5">“She has been with you long?” “Fifteen years.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You consider her trustworthy?”</p>
        <p class="p304 ft3">
          “Absolutely. Her people come from an estate of my late husband’s in
          Germany.” “You have been in America, I presume, Madame?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The abrupt change of subject made the old lady raise her eyebrows.
          “Many times.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Were you at any time acquainted with a family of the name of
          <nobr>Armstrong—a</nobr> family in which a tragedy occurred?”
        </p>
        <p class="p128 ft3">
          With some emotion in her voice the old lady said: “You speak of
          friends of mine, Monsieur.” “You knew Colonel Armstrong well, then?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I knew him slightly, but his wife, Sonia Armstrong, was my
          <nobr>god-daughter.</nobr> I was on terms of friendship with her
          mother, the actress, Linda Arden. Linda Arden was a great genius, one
          of the greatest tragic actresses in the world. As Lady Macbeth, as
          Magda, there was no one to touch her. I was not only an admirer of her
          art, I was a personal friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“She is dead?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, no, she is alive, but she lives in complete retirement. Her
          health is very delicate, and she has to lie on a sofa most of the
          time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p305 ft3">
          “There was, I think, a second daughter?” “Yes, much younger than Mrs.
          Armstrong.” “And she is alive?”
        </p>
        <p class="p306 ft5">“Certainly.” “Where is she?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The old woman bent an acute glance at him.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I must ask you the reason for these questions. What have they to do
          with the matter in <nobr>hand—the</nobr> murder on this train?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “They are connected in this way, Madame: the man who was murdered was
          the man responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Mrs. Armstrong’s
          child.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Ah!”</p>

          The straight brows came together. Princess Dragomiroff drew herself a
          little more erect.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “In my view, then, this murder is an entirely admirable happening! You
          will pardon my slightly biased point of view.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is most natural, Madame. And now to return to the question you did
          not answer. Where is the younger daughter of Linda Arden, the sister
          of Mrs. Armstrong?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur. I have lost touch with the
          younger generation. I believe she married an Englishman some years ago
          and went to England, but at the moment I cannot recollect the name.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">She paused a minute and then said:</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Is there anything further you want to ask me, gentlemen?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Only one thing, Madame, a somewhat personal question. The colour of
          your dressing- gown.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          She raised her eyebrows slightly. “I must suppose you have a reason
          for such a question. My <nobr>dressing-gown</nobr> is of black satin.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “There is nothing more, Madame. I am much obliged to you for answering
          my questions so promptly.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She made a slight gesture with her heavily beringed hand. Then as she
          rose, and the others rose with her, she stopped.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You will excuse me, Monsieur,” she said, “but may I ask your name?
          Your face is somehow familiar to me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “My name, Madame, is Hercule <nobr>Poirot—at</nobr> your service.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She was silent a minute, then: “Hercule Poirot,” she said. “Yes. I
          remember now. This is Destiny.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          She walked away, very erect, a little stiff in her movements.
        </p>
        <p class="p307 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Voilà une grande dame</span>,” said M. Bouc. “What
          do you think of her, my friend?” But Hercule Poirot merely shook his
          head.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I am wondering,” he said, “what she meant by Destiny.”

        <p class="p159 ft3">
          Count and Countess Andrenyi were next summoned. The Count, however,
          entered the <nobr>dining-car</nobr> alone.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          There was no doubt that he was a <nobr>fine-looking</nobr> man seen
          face to face. He was at least six feet in height, with broad shoulders
          and slender hips. He was dressed in very <nobr>well-cut</nobr> English
          tweeds and might have been taken for an Englishman had it not been for
          the length of his moustache and something in the line of the
          cheekbone.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Well, Messieurs,” he said, “what can I do for you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You understand, Monsieur,” said Poirot, “that in view of what has
          occurred I am obliged to put certain questions to all the passengers.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Perfectly, perfectly,” said the Count easily. “I quite understand
          your position. Not, I fear, that my wife and I can do much to assist
          you. We were asleep and heard nothing at all.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Are you aware of the identity of the deceased, Monsieur?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I understood it was the big <nobr>American—a</nobr> man with a
          decidedly unpleasant face. He sat at that table at meal times.” He
          indicated with a nod of his head the table at which Ratchett and
          MacQueen had sat.
        </p>
        <p class="p309 ft3">
          “Yes, yes, Monsieur, you are perfectly correct. I
          <nobr>meant—did</nobr> you know the name of the man?” “No.” The Count
          looked thoroughly puzzled by Poirot’s queries.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “If you want to know his name,” he said, “surely it is on his
          passport?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The name on his passport is Ratchett,” said Poirot. “But that,
          Monsieur, is not his real name. He is the man Cassetti, who was
          responsible for a celebrated kidnapping outrage in America.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He watched the Count closely as he spoke, but the latter seemed quite
          unaffected by this piece of news. He merely opened his eyes a little.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah!” he said. “That certainly should throw light upon the matter. An
          extraordinary country, America.”
        </p>
        <p class="p310 ft5">
          “You have been there, perhaps, Monsieur le Comte?” “I was in
          Washington for a year.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You knew, perhaps, the Armstrong family?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“Armstrong—Armstrong—it</nobr> is difficult to recall. One met
          so many.” He smiled, shrugged his shoulders. “But to come back to the
          matter in hand, gentlemen,” he said. “What more can I do to assist
          you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You retired to <nobr>rest—when,</nobr> Monsieur le Comte?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Hercule Poirot’s eyes stole to his plan. Count and Countess Andrenyi
          occupied compartment Nos. 12 and 13 adjoining.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “We had one compartment made up for the night whilst we were in the
          <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> On returning we sat in the other for a
          <nobr>while—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Which number would that be?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No. 13. We played piquet together. At about eleven o’clock my wife
          retired for the night. The conductor made up my compartment and I also
          went to bed. I slept soundly until morning.”
        </p>
        <p class="p311 ft3">
          “Did you notice the stopping of the train?” “I was not aware of it
          till this morning.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id65_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_66">
      <div id="id66_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">“And your wife?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The Count smiled. “My wife always takes a sleeping draught when
          travelling by train. She took her usual dose of trional.”
        </p>
        <p class="p76 ft5">
          He paused. “I am sorry I am not able to assist you in any way.” Poirot
          passed him a sheet of paper and a pen.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Thank you, Monsieur le Comte. It is a formality, but will you just
          let me have your name and address?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The Count wrote slowly and carefully.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is just as well that I should write this for you,” he said
          pleasantly. “The spelling of my country estate is a little difficult
          for those unacquainted with the language.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He passed the paper across to Poirot and rose.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It will be quite unnecessary for my wife to come here,” he said. “She
          can tell you nothing more than I have.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">A little gleam came into Poirot’s eye.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Doubtless, doubtless,” he said. “But all the same I think I should
          like to have just one little word with Madame la Comtesse.”
        </p>
        <p class="p312 ft3">
          “I assure you it is quite unnecessary.” The Count’s voice rang out
          authoritatively. Poirot blinked gently at him.
        </p>
        <p class="p313 ft5">
          “It will be a mere formality,” he said. “But, you understand, it is
          necessary for my report.” “As you please.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The Count gave way grudgingly. He made a short foreign bow and left
          the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot reached out a hand to a passport. It set out the Count’s names
          and titles. He passed on to the further information. “<span
            class="ft22"
            >Accompanied by</span
          >, wife; <span class="ft22">Christian name</span>, Elena Maria;
          <span class="ft22">maiden name</span>, Goldenberg;
          <span class="ft22">age</span>, twenty.” A spot of grease had been
          dropped on it at some time by a careless official.
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “A diplomatic passport,” said M. Bouc. “We must be careful, my friend,
          to give no offence. These people can have nothing to do with the
          murder.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Be easy, <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>, I will be most tactful.
          A mere formality.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          His voice dropped as the Countess Andrenyi entered the
          <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> She looked timid and extremely charming.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You wish to see me, Messieurs?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “A mere formality, Madam la Comtesse.” Poirot rose gallantly, bowed
          her into the seat opposite him. “It is only to ask you if you saw or
          heard anything last night that may throw light upon this matter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">“Nothing at all, Monsieur. I was asleep.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You did not hear, for instance, a commotion going on in the
          compartment next to yours? The American lady who occupies it had quite
          an attack of hysterics and rang for the conductor.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I heard nothing, Monsieur. You see, I had taken a sleeping draught.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah! I comprehend. Well, I need not detain you further.” Then, as she
          rose <nobr>swiftly—“Just</nobr> one little minute. These
          <nobr>particulars—your</nobr> maiden name, age and so
          <nobr>on—they</nobr> are correct?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Quite correct, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Perhaps you will sign this memorandum to that effect, then.”
        </p>
        <p class="p314 ft5">
          She signed quickly, in a graceful slanting
          <nobr>hand-writing—<span class="ft4">Elena</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft4"> Andrenyi</span>. “Did you accompany your husband
          to America, Madame?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “No, Monsieur.” She smiled, flushed a little. “We were not married
          then; we have been married only a year.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id66_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_67">
      <div id="id67_1">
        <p class="p315 ft3">
          “Ah, yes, thank you, Madame. By the way, does your husband smoke?” She
          stared at him as she stood poised for departure.
        </p>
        <p class="p316 ft3">“Yes.” “A pipe?”</p>
        <p class="p317 ft5">“No. Cigarettes and cigars.” “Ah! Thank you.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She lingered, her eyes watching him curiously. Lovely eyes they were,
          dark and almond- shaped with very long black lashes that swept the
          exquisite pallor of her cheeks. Her lips, very scarlet in the foreign
          fashion, were parted just a little. She looked exotic and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why did you ask me that?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Madame,” Poirot waved an airy hand, “detectives have to ask all sorts
          of questions. For instance, perhaps you will tell me the colour of
          your <nobr>dressing-gown?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p288 ft5">
          She stared at him. Then she laughed. “it is
          <nobr>corn-coloured</nobr> chiffon. Is that really important?” “Very
          important, Madame.”
        </p>
        <p class="p226 ft3">
          She asked curiously: “Are you really a detective, then?” “At your
          service, Madame.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I thought there were no detectives on the train when it passed
          through <nobr>Jugo-Slavia—not</nobr> until one got to Italy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p318 ft5">
          “I am not a <nobr>Jugo-Slavian</nobr> detective, Madame. I am an
          international detective.” “You belong to the League of Nations?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I belong to the world, Madame,” said Poirot dramatically. He went on:
          “I work mainly in London. You speak English?” he added in that
          language.
        </p>
        <p class="p319 ft5">
          “I speak a leetle, yes.” Her accent was charming. Poirot bowed once
          more. “We will not detain you further, Madame. You see, it was not so
          very terrible.” She smiled, inclined her head and departed.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Elle est jolie femme</span>,” said M. Bouc
          appreciatively. He sighed. “Well, that did not advance us much.”
        </p>
        <p class="p187 ft5">
          “No,” said Poirot. “Two people who saw nothing and heard nothing.”
          “Shall we now see the Italian?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Poirot did not reply for a moment. He was studying a grease spot on a
          Hungarian diplomatic passport.

          “Ah! my dear old friend,” he said, “you see I have become what they
          call the snob! The first class, I feel it should be attended to before
          the second class. Next, I think, we will interview the
          <nobr>good-looking</nobr> Colonel Arbuthnot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Finding the Colonel’s French to be of a severely limited description,
          Poirot conducted his interrogatory in English.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Arbuthnot’s name, age, home address and exact military standing were
          all ascertained. Poirot proceeded:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is that you come home from India on what is called the
          <nobr>leave—what</nobr> we can call
          <span class="ft22">en permission</span>?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft23">
          Colonel Arbuthnot, uninterested in what a pack of foreigners called
          anything, replied with true British brevity, “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p321 ft5">
          “But you do not come home on the P. & O. boat?” “No.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why not?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I chose to come by the overland route for reasons of my own.”
        </p>
        <p class="p322 ft5">
          (“And that,” his manner seemed to say, “is one for you, you
          interfering little jackanapes.”) “You came straight through from
          India?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The Colonel replied drily: “I stopped for one night to see Ur of the
          Chaldees, and for three days in Baghdad with the A.O.C., who happens
          to be an old friend of mine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You stopped three days in Baghdad. I understand that the young
          English lady, Miss Debenham, also comes from Baghdad. Perhaps you met
          her there?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, I did not. I first met Miss Debenham when she and I shared the
          railway convoy car from Kirkuk to Nissibin.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot leaned forward. He became persuasive and a little more foreign
          than he need have been.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “Monsieur, I am about to appeal to you. You and Miss Debenham are the
          only two English people on the train. It is necessary that I should
          ask you each your opinion of the other.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Highly irregular,” said Colonel Arbuthnot coldly.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Not so. You see, this crime, it was most probably committed by a
          woman. The man was stabbed no fewer than twelve times. Even the
          <span class="ft4">chef de train </span>said at once, ‘It is a woman.’
          Well, then, what is my first task? To give all the women travelling on
          the <nobr>Istanbul-Calais</nobr> coach what Americans call the
          <nobr>‘once-over.’</nobr> But to judge of an Englishwoman is
          difficult. They are very reserved, the English. So I appeal to you,
          Monsieur, in the interest of justice. What sort of person is this Miss
          Debenham? What do you know about her?”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          “Miss Debenham,” said the Colonel with some warmth, “is a lady.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Ah!” said Poirot with every appearance of being much gratified. “So
          you do not think that she is likely to be implicated in this crime?”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id68_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_69">
      <div id="id69_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “The idea is absurd,” said Arbuthnot. “The man was a perfect
          <nobr>stranger—she</nobr> had never seen him before.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Did she tell you so?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “She did. She commented at once upon his somewhat unpleasant
          appearance. If a woman is concerned, as you seem to think (to my mind
          without any evidence but on a mere assumption), I can assure you that
          Miss Debenham could not possibly be implicated.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You feel warmly in the matter,” said Poirot with a smile.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Colonel Arbuthnot gave him a cold stare. “I really don’t know what you
          mean,” he said.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The stare seemed to abash Poirot. He dropped his eyes and began
          fiddling with the papers in front of him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “All this is by the way,” he said. “Let us be practical and come to
          facts. This crime, we have reason to believe, took place at a quarter
          past one last night. It is part of the necessary routine to ask
          everyone on the train what he or she was doing at that time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Quite so. At a quarter past one, to the best of my belief, I was
          talking to the young American <nobr>fellow—secretary</nobr> to the
          dead man.”
        </p>
        <p class="p323 ft5">
          “Ah! were you in his compartment, or was he in yours?” “I was in his.”
        </p>
        <p class="p324 ft3">
          “That is the young man of the name of MacQueen?” “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“He was a friend or acquaintance of yours?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, I never saw him before this journey. We fell into casual
          conversation yesterday and both became interested. I don’t as a rule
          like <nobr>Americans—haven’t</nobr> any use for <nobr>’em—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot smiled, remembering MacQueen’s strictures on “Britishers.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          <nobr>“—but</nobr> I liked this young fellow. He’d got hold of some
          tomfool idiotic ideas about the situation in India. That’s the worst
          of <nobr>Americans—they’re</nobr> so sentimental and idealistic. Well,
          he was interested in what I had to tell him. I’ve had nearly thirty
          years’ experience of the country. And I was interested in what he had
          to tell me about the working of Prohibition in America. Then we got
          down to world politics in general. I was quite surprised to look at my
          watch and find it was a quarter to two.”
        </p>
        <p class="p325 ft3">
          “That is the time you broke up this conversation?” “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What did you do then?”</p>
        <p class="p326 ft5">
          “Walked along to my own compartment and turned in.” “Your bed was made
          up ready?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “That is the <nobr>compartment—let</nobr> me <nobr>see—No.</nobr>
          <nobr>15—the</nobr> one next but one to the end away from the
          <nobr>dining-car?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Where was the conductor when you went to your compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Sitting at the end at a little table. As a matter of fact MacQueen
          called him just as I went in to my own compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why did he call him?”</p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “To make up his bed, I suppose. The compartment hadn’t been made up
          for the night.” “Now, Colonel Arbuthnot, I want you to think
          carefully. During the time you were talking to
        </p>
        <p class="p327 ft3">
          Mr. MacQueen, did anyone pass along the corridor outside the door?” “A
          good many people, I should think. I wasn’t paying attention.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id69_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_70">
      <div id="id70_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “Ah! but I am referring <nobr>to—let</nobr> us say, the last hour and
          a half of your conversation. You got out at Vincovci, didn’t you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes, but only for about a minute. There was a blizzard on. The cold
          was something frightful. Made one quite thankful to get back to the
          fug, though as a rule I think the way these trains are overheated is
          something scandalous.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc sighed. “It is very difficult to please everybody,” he said.
          “The English they open <nobr>everything—then</nobr> others they come
          along and shut everything. It is very difficult.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Neither Poirot nor Colonel Arbuthnot paid any attention to him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Now, Monsieur, cast your mind back,” said Poirot encouragingly. “It
          was cold outside. You have returned to the train. You sit down again,
          you <nobr>smoke—perhaps</nobr> a <nobr>cigarette—perhaps</nobr> a
          <nobr>pipe—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">He paused for the fraction of a second.</p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">“A pipe for me. MacQueen smoked cigarettes.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The train starts again. You smoke your pipe. You discuss the state of
          <nobr>Europe—of</nobr> the world. It is late now. Most people have
          retired for the night. Does anyone pass the door? Think.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot frowned in the effort of remembrance.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Difficult to say,” he said. “You see I wasn’t paying any attention.”
        </p>
        <p class="p328 ft5">
          “But you have the soldier’s observation for detail. You notice without
          noticing, so to speak.” The Colonel thought again, but shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I couldn’t say. I don’t remember anyone passing except the conductor.
          Wait a <nobr>minute—and</nobr> there was a woman, I think.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You saw her? Was she <nobr>old—young?”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p329 ft5">
          “Didn’t see her. Wasn’t looking that way. just a rustle and a sort of
          smell of scent.” “Scent? A <span class="ft4">good </span>scent?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, rather fruity, if you know what I mean. I mean you’d smell it a
          hundred yards away. But mind you,” the Colonel went on hastily, “this
          may have been earlier in the evening. You see, as you said just now,
          it was just one of those things you notice without noticing, so to
          speak. Some time that evening I said to
          <nobr>myself—‘Woman—scent—got</nobr> it on pretty thick.’ But
          <span class="ft4">when </span>it was I can’t be sure, except
          <nobr>that—why,</nobr> yes, it must have been after Vincovci.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Because I <nobr>remember—sniffing,</nobr> you
          <nobr>know—just</nobr> when I was talking about the utter washout
          Stalin’s Five Year Plan was turning out. I know the idea
          <span class="ft22">woman </span>brought the idea of the position of
          women in Russia into my mind. And I know we hadn’t got on to Russia
          until pretty near the end of our talk.”
        </p>
        <p class="p330 ft3">
          “You can’t pin it down more definitely than that?”
          <nobr>“N-no.</nobr> It must have been roughly within the last
          <nobr>half-hour.”</nobr> “It was after the train had stopped?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The other nodded. “Yes, I’m almost sure it was.”</p>
        <p class="p68 ft5">
          “Well, we will pass from that. Have you ever been in America, Colonel
          Arbuthnot?” “Never. Don’t want to go.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          <nobr>“Armstrong—Armstrong—I’ve</nobr> known two or three Armstrongs.
          There was Tommy Armstrong in the <nobr>60th—you</nobr> don’t mean him?
          And Selby <nobr>Armstrong—he</nobr> was killed on the Somme.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “I mean the Colonel Armstrong who married an American wife and whose
          only child was kidnapped and killed.”
        </p>

      <div id="id70_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_71">
      <div id="id71_1">
        <p class="p138 ft3">
          “Ah, yes, I remember reading about <nobr>that—shocking</nobr> affair.
          I don’t think I actually ever came across the fellow, though of course
          I knew of him. Toby Armstrong. Nice fellow. Everybody liked him. He
          had a very distinguished career. Got the V.C.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The man who was killed last night was the man responsible for the
          murder of Colonel Armstrong’s child.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Arbuthnot’s face grew rather grim. “Then in my opinion the swine
          deserved what he got. Though I would have preferred to see him
          properly <nobr>hanged—or</nobr> electrocuted, I suppose, over there.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          “In fact, Colonel Arbuthnot, you prefer law and order to private
          vengeance?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well, you can’t go about having blood feuds and stabbing each other
          like Corsicans or the Mafia,” said the Colonel. “Say what you like,
          trial by jury is a sound system.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or two.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes,” he said. I am sure that would be your view. Well, Colonel
          Arbuthnot, I do not think there is anything more I have to ask you.
          There is nothing you yourself can recall last night that in any way
          snuck <nobr>you—or</nobr> shall we say strikes you now, looking
          <nobr>back—as</nobr> suspicious?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot considered for a moment or two.</p>
        <p class="p331 ft3">
          “No,” he said. “Nothing at all. <nobr>Unless—”</nobr> he hesitated.
          “But yes, continue, I pray of you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p189 ft5">
          “Well, it’s nothing really,” said the Colonel slowly. “But you said
          <span class="ft4">anything</span>.” “Yes, yes. Go on.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh! it’s nothing. A mere detail. But as I got back to my compartment
          I noticed that the door of the one beyond <nobr>mine—the</nobr> end
          one, you <nobr>know—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, No. 16.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, the door of it was not quite closed. And the fellow inside
          peered out in a furtive sort of way. Then he pulled the door to
          quickly. Of course I know there’s nothing in <nobr>that—but</nobr> it
          just struck me as a bit odd. I mean, it’s quite usual to open a door
          and stick your head out if you want to see anything. But it was the
          furtive way he did it that caught my attention.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3"><nobr>“Ye-es,”</nobr> said Poirot doubtfully.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I told you there was nothing to it,” said Arbuthnot, apologetically.
          “But you know what it <nobr>is—early</nobr> hours of the
          <nobr>morning—everything</nobr> very still. The thing had a sinister
          <nobr>look—like</nobr> a detective story. All nonsense really.”
        </p>
        <p class="p332 ft5">
          He rose. “Well, if you don’t want me any <nobr>more—”</nobr> “Thank
          you, Colonel Arbuthnot, there is nothing else.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The soldier hesitated for a minute. His first natural distaste for
          being questioned by “foreigners” had evaporated.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “About Miss Debenham,” he said rather awkwardly. “You can take it from
          me that she’s all right. She’s a
          <span class="ft22">pukka sahib</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Flushing a little, he withdrew.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “What,” asked Dr. Constantine with interest, “does a
          <span class="ft4">pukka sahib </span>mean?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It means,” said Poirot, “that Miss Debenham’s father and brothers
          were at the same kind of school as Colonel Arbuthnot was.”
        </p>
        <p class="p122 ft3">
          “Oh! said Dr. Constantine, disappointed. “Then it has nothing to do
          with the crime at all.” “Exactly,”, said, Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          He fell into a reverie, beating a light tattoo on the table. Then he
          looked up.
        </p>

          “Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a pipe,” he said. “In the compartment of Mr.
          Ratchett I found a <nobr>pipe-cleaner.</nobr> Mr. Ratchett smoked only
          cigars.”

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “He is the only man so far who admits to smoking a pipe. And he knew
          of Colonel <nobr>Armstrong—perhaps</nobr> actually did know him,
          though he won’t admit it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p333 ft5">
          “So you think it <nobr>possible—?”</nobr> Poirot shook his head
          violently.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is just <nobr>it—it</nobr> is
          <nobr><span class="ft22">im</span>possible—quite</nobr>
          <nobr>impossible—that</nobr> an honourable, slightly stupid, upright
          Englishman should stab an enemy twelve times with a knife! Do you not
          feel, my friends, how impossible it is?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“That is the psychology,” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “And one must respect the psychology. This crime has a signature, and
          it is certainly not the signature of Colonel Arbuthnot. But now to our
          next interview.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          This time M. Bouc did not mention the Italian. But he thought of him.

        <p class="p334 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF MR. HARDMAN</p>
        <p class="p159 ft3">
          The last of the <nobr>first-class</nobr> passengers to be interviewed,
          Mr. Hardman, was the big flamboyant American who had shared a table
          with the Italian and the valet.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He wore a somewhat loud check suit, a pink shirt, and a flashy
          <nobr>tie-pin,</nobr> and was rolling something round his tongue as he
          entered the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> He had a big, fleshy,
          <nobr>coarse-featured</nobr> face, with a
          <nobr>good-humoured</nobr> expression.
        </p>
        <p class="p335 ft3">
          “Morning, gentlemen,” he said. “What can I do for you?” “You have
          heard of this murder, <nobr>Mr.—er—Hardman?”</nobr> “Sure.” He shifted
          the chewing gum deftly.
        </p>
        <p class="p336 ft5">
          “We are of necessity interviewing all the passengers on the train.”
          “That’s all right by me. Guess that’s the only way to tackle the job.”
          Poirot consulted the passport lying in front of him.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You are Cyrus Bethman Hardman, United States subject,
          <nobr>forty-one</nobr> years of age, travelling salesman for
          typewriting ribbons?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“O.K. That’s me.”</p>
        <p class="p245 ft5">
          you are travelling from Stamboul to Paris?” “That’s so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Reason?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Business.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Do you always travel <nobr>first-class,</nobr> Mr. Hardman?”
        </p>
        <p class="p337 ft5">
          “Yes, sir. The firm pays my travelling expenses. “ He winked. “Now,
          Mr. Hardman, we come to the events of last night.” The American
          nodded.
        </p>
        <p class="p338 ft3">
          “What can you tell us about the matter?” “Exactly nothing at all.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Ah, that is a pity. Perhaps, Mr. Hardman, you will tell us exactly
          what you did last night from dinner onwards?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          For the first time the American did not seem ready with his reply. At
          last he said: “Excuse me, gentlemen, but just who are you? Put me
          wise.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “This is M. Bouc, a director of the Compagnie des Wagons Lits. This
          gentleman is the doctor who examined the body.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And you yourself?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I am Hercule Poirot. I am engaged by the company to investigate this
          matter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I’ve heard of you,” said Mr. Hardman. He reflected a minute or two
          longer. “Guess I’d better come clean.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It will certainly be advisable for you to tell us all you know,” said
          Poirot drily.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “You’d have said a mouthful if there was anything I
          <span class="ft4">did </span>know. But I don’t. I know nothing at
          <nobr>all—just</nobr> as I said. But I
          <span class="ft4">ought </span>to know something. That’s what makes me
          sore. I <span class="ft4">ought </span>to.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Please explain, Mr. Hardman.”</p>

          Mr. Hardman sighed, removed the chewing gum, and dived into a pocket.
          At the same time his whole personality seemed to undergo a change. He
          became less of a stage character and more of a real person. The
          resonant nasal tones of his voice became modified.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “That passport’s a bit of bluff,” he said. “That’s who I really am.”

        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot scrutinised the card flipped across to him. M. Bouc peered over
          his shoulder.
        </p>
        <p class="p339 ft3">
          Poirot knew the name as that of one of the <nobr>best-known</nobr> and
          most reputable private detective agencies in New York.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Now, Mr. Hardman,” he said, “let us hear the meaning of this.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Sure. Things came about this way. I’d come over to Europe trailing a
          couple of crooks— nothing to do with this business. The chase ended in
          Stamboul. I wired the Chief and got his instructions to return, and I
          would have been making my tracks back to little old New York when I
          got this.”

        <p class="p69 ft3">Dear Sir:</p>
        <p class="p340 ft3">
          You have been pointed out to me as an operative of the McNeil
          Detective Agency. Kindly report at my suite at four o’clock this

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I reported at the time stated, and Mr. Ratchett put me wise to the
          situation. He showed me a couple of letters he’d got.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“He was alarmed?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Pretended not to be, but he was rattled, all right. He put up a
          proposition to me. I was to travel by the same train as he did to
          Parrus and see that nobody got him. Well, gentlemen, I
          <span class="ft4">did </span>travel by the same train, and in spite of
          me, somebody <span class="ft4">did </span>get him. I certainly feel
          sore about it. It doesn’t look any too good for me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Did he give you any indication of the line you were to take?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Sure. He had it all taped out. It was his idea that I should travel
          in the compartment alongside his. Well, that blew up right at the
          start. The only place I could get was berth No. 16, and I had a job
          getting that. I guess the conductor likes to keep that compartment up
          his sleeve. But that’s neither here nor there. When I looked all round
          the situation, it seemed to me that No. 16 was a

          the door onto the platform at the front end was barred at night. The
          only way a thug could come was through the <nobr>rear-end</nobr> door
          to the platform, or along the train from the rear, and in either case
          he’d have to pass right by my compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p342 ft5">
          “You had no idea, I suppose, of the identity of the possible
          assailant?” “Well, I knew what he looked like. Mr. Ratchett described
          him to me.” “What?”
        </p>
        <p class="p343 ft3">
          All three men leaned forward eagerly. Hardman went on.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “A small <nobr>man—dark—with</nobr> a womanish kind of voice. That’s
          what the old man said. Said, too, that he didn’t think it would be the
          first night out, More likely the second or third.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“He knew something,” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p81 ft5">
          “He certainly knew more than he told his secretary,” commented Poirot
          thoughtfully. “Did he tell you anything about this enemy of his? Did
          he, for instance, say <span class="ft4">why </span>his life was
          threatened?” “No, he was kinda reticent about that part of it. just
          said the <nobr>fellow-was</nobr> out for his blood and
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">meant to get it.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “A small <nobr>man—dark—with</nobr> a womanish voice,” repeated Poirot
          thoughtfully. Then, fixing a sharp glance on Hardman, he asked: “You
          knew who he really was, of course?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Which, Mister?”</p>
        <p class="p344 ft5">
          “Ratchett. You recognised him?” “I don’t get you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p345 ft3">
          “Ratchett was Cassetti, the Armstrong murderer.” Mr. Hardman gave vent
          to a prolonged whistle.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That certainly is some surprise!” he said. “Yes,
          <span class="ft4">sir</span>! No, I didn’t recognise him. I was away
          out West when that case came on. I suppose I saw photos of him in the
          papers, but I wouldn’t recognise my own mother when a newspaper
          photographer got through with her. Well, I don’t doubt that a few
          people had it in for Cassetti all right.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Do you know of anyone connected with the Armstrong case who answers to
          that description: <nobr>small—dark—womanish</nobr> voice?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Hardman reflected a minute or two. “It’s hard to say. Pretty nearly
          everyone connected with that case is dead.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “There was the girl who threw herself out of the window, remember.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Sure. That’s a good point, that. She was a foreigner of some kind.
          Maybe she had some Wop relations. But you’ve got to remember that
          there were other cases besides the Armstrong one. Cassetti had been
          running this kidnapping stunt for some time. You can’t concentrate on
          that only.”
        </p>
        <p class="p298 ft3">
          Ah, but we have reason to believe that this crime
          <span class="ft22">is </span>connected with the Armstrong case.” Mr.
          Hardman cocked an inquiring eye. Poirot did not respond. The American
          shook his head. “I can’t call to mind anybody answering that
          description in the Armstrong case,” he said
        </p>
        <p class="p346 ft3">
          slowly. “But of course I wasn’t in it and didn’t know much about it.”
          “Well, continue your narrative, Mr. Hardman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “There’s very little to tell. I got my sleep in the daytime and stayed
          awake on the watch at night. Nothing suspicious happened the first
          night. Last night was the same, as far as I was concerned. I had my
          door a little ajar and watched. No stranger passed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You are sure of that, Mr. Hardman?”</p>
      </div>

    <div id="page_76">
      <div id="id76_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “I’m plumb certain. Nobody got on that train from outside, and nobody
          came along the train from the rear carriages. I’ll take my oath on
          that.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Could you see the conductor from your position?”</p>
        <p class="p347 ft5">
          “Sure. He sits on that little seat almost flush with my door.” “Did he
          leave that seat at all after the train stopped at Vincovci?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That was the last station? Why, yes, he answered a couple of
          <nobr>bells—that</nobr> would be just after the train came to a halt
          for good. Then, after that, he went past me into the rear
          <nobr>coach—was</nobr> there about a quarter of an hour. There was a
          bell ringing like mad and he came back running. I stepped out into the
          corridor to see what it was all <nobr>about—felt</nobr> a mite
          nervous, you understand— but it was only the American dame. She was
          raising hell about something or other, I grinned. Then he went on to
          another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water
          for someone. After that he settled down in his seat till he went up to
          the far end to make somebody’s bed up. I don’t think he stirred after
          that until about five o’clock this morning.”
        </p>
        <p class="p348 ft3">“Did he doze off at all?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That I can’t say. He may have.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot nodded. Automatically his hands straightened the papers on the
          table. He picked up the official card once more.
        </p>
        <p class="p349 ft5">
          “Be so good as just to initial this,” he said. The other complied.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “There is no one, I suppose, who can confirm your story of your
          identity, Mr. Hardman?” “On this train? Well, not exactly. Unless it
          might be young MacQueen. I know him well
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft5">
          <nobr>enough—I’ve</nobr> seen him in his father’s office in New York.
          But that’s not to say he’ll remember me from a crowd of other
          operatives. No, Mr. Poirot, you’ll have to wait and cable New York
          when the snow lets up. But it’s O.K. I’m not telling the tale. Well,
          so long, gentlemen. Pleased to have met you, Mr. Poirot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p350 ft3">
          Poirot proffered his cigarette case. “But perhaps you prefer a pipe?”
          “Not me.” He helped himself, then strode briskly off.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The three men looked at each other.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You think he is genuine?” asked Dr. Constantine.</p>
        <p class="p79 ft5">
          “Yes, yes. I know the type. Besides, it is a story that would be very
          easy to disprove.” “He has given us a piece of very interesting
          evidence,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, indeed.”</p>
        <p class="p264 ft23">
          “A small <nobr>man—dark—with</nobr> a
          <nobr>high-pitched</nobr> voice,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “A
          description which applies to no one on the train,” said Poirot.

          “And now,” said Poirot with a twinkle in his eye, “we will delight the
          heart of M. Bouc and see the Italian.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Antonio Foscarelli came into the <nobr>dining-car</nobr> with a swift,
          <nobr>cat-like</nobr> tread. His face beamed. It was a typical Italian
          face, <nobr>sunny-looking</nobr> and swarthy.
        </p>
        <p class="p353 ft3">
          He spoke French well and fluently with only a slight accent. “Your
          name is Antonio Foscarelli?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“You are, I see, a naturalised American subject?”</p>
        <p class="p354 ft5">
          The American grinned. “Yes, Monsieur. It is better for my business.”
          “You are an agent for Ford motor cars?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, you <nobr>see—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          A voluble exposition followed. At the end of it anything that the
          three men did not know about Foscarelli’s business methods, his
          journeys, his income, and his opinion of the United States and most
          European countries seemed a negligible factor. This was not a man who
          had to have information dragged from him. It gushed out.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His <nobr>good-natured,</nobr> childish face beamed with satisfaction
          as, with a last eloquent gesture, he paused and wiped his forehead
          with a handkerchief.
        </p>
        <p class="p355 ft5">
          “So you see,” he said. “I do big business. I am up to date. I
          understand salesmanship!” “You have been in the United States, then,
          for the last ten years on and off.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Yes, Monsieur. Ah! well do I remember the day I first took the
          <nobr>boat—to</nobr> go to America, so far away! My mother, my little
          <nobr>sister—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot cut short the flood of reminiscence.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “During your sojourn in the United States, did you ever come across
          the deceased?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Never. But I know the type. Oh! yes.” He snapped his fingers
          expressively. “It is very respectable, very
          <nobr>well-dressed,</nobr> but underneath it is all wrong. Out of my
          experience I should say he was the big crook. I give you my opinion
          for what it is worth.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Your opinion is quite right,” said Poirot drily. “Ratchett was
          Cassetti, the kidnapper.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “What did I tell you? I have learned to be very
          <nobr>acute—to</nobr> read the face. It is necessary. Only in America
          do they teach you the proper way to sell. <nobr>I—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You remember the Armstrong case?”</p>
        <p class="p304 ft3">
          “I do not quite remember. The name, yes? It was a little girl, a baby,
          was it not?” “Yes, a very tragic affair.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The Italian seemed the first person to demur to this view.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Ah! well, these things they happen,” he said philosophically, “in a
          great civilisation such as <nobr>America—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          Poirot cut him short. “Did you ever come across any members of the
          Armstrong family?” “No, I do not think so. It is difficult to say. I
          will give you some figures. Last year alone, I
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft5"><nobr>sold—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Monsieur, pray confine yourself to the point.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The Italian’s hands flung themselves out in a gesture of apology. “A
          thousand pardons.”

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “With pleasure. I stay here as long as I can. It is more amusing. I
          talk to the American gentleman at my table. He sells typewriter
          ribbons. Then I go back to my compartment. It is empty. The miserable
          John Bull who shares it with me is away attending to his master. At
          last he comes <nobr>back—very</nobr> long face as usual. He will not
          <nobr>talk—says</nobr> yes and no. A miserable race, the
          <nobr>English—not</nobr> sympathetic. He sits in the corner, very
          stiff, reading a book, Then the conductor comes and makes our beds.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“Nos. 4 and 5,” murmured Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“Exactly—the</nobr> end compartment. Mine is the upper berth. I
          get up there. I smoke and read. The little Englishman has, I think,
          the toothache. He gets out a little bottle of stuff that smells very
          strong. He lies in bed and groans. Presently I sleep. Whenever I wake
          I hear him groaning.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Do you know if he left the carriage at all during the night?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I do not think so. That, I should hear. The light from the
          <nobr>corridor—one</nobr> wakes up automatically thinking it is the
          customs examination at some frontier.”
        </p>
        <p class="p356 ft5">
          “Did he ever speak of his master? Ever express any animus against
          him?” “I tell you he did not speak. He was not sympathetic. A fish.”
        </p>
        <p class="p357 ft3">
          “You smoke, you <nobr>say—a</nobr> pipe, cigarettes, cigar?”
          “Cigarettes only.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Poirot proffered one, which he accepted.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Have you ever been to Chicago?” inquired M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh! <nobr>yes—a</nobr> fine <nobr>city—but</nobr> I know best New

          go. <nobr>It—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot pushed a sheet of paper across to him.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “If you will sign this, and put your permanent address, please.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The Italian wrote with a flourish. Then he rose, his smile as engaging
          as ever.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That is all? You do not require me further? Good day to you,
          Messieurs. I wish we could get out of the snow. I have an appointment
          in Milan.” He shook his head sadly. “I shall lose the business.” He
          departed.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked at his friend.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “He has been a long time in America,” said M. Bouc, “and he is an
          Italian, and Italians use the knife! And they are great liars! I do
          not like Italians.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Ça se voit</span>,” said Poirot with a smile “Well,
          it may be that you are right, but I will point out to you, my friend,
          that there is absolutely no evidence against the man.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “And what about the psychology? Do not Italians stab?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Assuredly,” said Poirot. “Especially in the heat of a quarrel. But
          <nobr>this—this</nobr> is a different kind of crime. I have the little
          idea, my friend, that this is a crime very carefully planned and
          staged. It is a <nobr>far-sighted,</nobr>
          <nobr>long-headed</nobr> crime. it is <nobr>not—how</nobr> shall I
          express <nobr>it?—a</nobr> <span class="ft4">Latin </span>crime. It is

          When Mary Debenham entered the <nobr>dining-car</nobr> she confirmed
          Poirot’s previous estimate of her. She was very neatly dressed in a
          little black suit with a French grey shirt, and the smooth waves of
          her dark head were neat and unruffled. Her manner was as calm and
          unruffled as her hair.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She sat down opposite Poirot and M. Bouc and looked at them
          inquiringly.

          “And now, Mademoiselle, what have you to tell us of the affair last
          night?” “I am afraid I have nothing to tell you. I went to bed and
          slept.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Does it distress you very much, Mademoiselle, that a crime has been
          committed on this train?”
        </p>
        <p class="p360 ft23">
          The question was clearly unexpected. Her grey eyes widened a little.
          “I don’t quite understand you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It was a perfectly simple question that I asked you, Mademoiselle. I
          will repeat it. Are you very much distressed that a crime should have
          been committed on this train?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I have not really thought about it from that point of view. No, I
          cannot say that I am at all distressed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “A <nobr>crime—it</nobr> is all in the day’s work to you, eh?”
        </p>
        <p class="p361 ft5">
          “It is naturally an unpleasant thing to have happen,” said Mary
          Debenham quietly. “You are very
          <nobr>Anglo-Saxon,</nobr> Mademoiselle.
          <span class="ft4">Vous n’éprouvez pas d’émotion</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She smiled a little. “I am afraid I cannot have hysterics to prove my
          sensibility. After all, people die every day.”
        </p>
        <p class="p362 ft5">
          “They die, yes. But murder is a little more rare.” “Oh! certainly.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You were not acquainted with the dead man?”</p>
        <p class="p363 ft5">
          “I saw him for the first time when lunching here yesterday.” “And how
          did he strike you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I hardly noticed him.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“He did not impress you as an evil personality?”</p>
        <p class="p148 ft5">
          She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “Really, I cannot say I thought
          about it.” Poirot looked at her keenly.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute my
          inquiries,” he said with a twinkle. “Not so, you think, would an
          English inquiry be conducted. There everything would be cut and
          <nobr>dried—it</nobr> would be all kept to the <nobr>facts—a</nobr>
          <nobr>well-ordered</nobr> business. But I, Mademoiselle, have my
          little originalities. I look first at my witness, I sum up his or her

          character, and I frame my questions accordingly. just a little minute
          ago I am asking questions of a gentleman who wants to tell me all his
          ideas on every subject. Well, him I keep strictly to the point. I want
          him to answer yes or no. This or that. And then you come. I see at
          once that you will be orderly and methodical. You will confine
          yourself to the matter in hand. Your answers will be brief and to the
          point. And because, Mademoiselle, human nature is perverse, I ask of
          you quite different questions. I ask what you feel, what you think. It
          does not please you, this method?”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “If you will forgive my saying so, it seems somewhat of a waste of
          time. Whether or not I liked Mr. Ratchett’s face does not seem likely
          to be helpful in finding out who killed him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p295 ft3">
          “Do you know who the man Ratchett really was, Mademoiselle?” She
          nodded. “Mrs. Hubbard has been telling everyone.”
        </p>
        <p class="p364 ft5">
          “And what do you think of the Armstrong affair?” “It was quite
          abominable,” said the girl crisply. Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p188 ft3">
          “You are travelling from Baghdad, I believe, Miss Debenham?” “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p365 ft5">“To London?” “Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What have you been doing in Baghdad?”</p>
        <p class="p366 ft5">
          “I have been acting as governess to two children.” “Are you returning
          to your post after your holiday?” “I am not sure.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why is that?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Baghdad is rather out of things. I think I should prefer a post in
          London if I can hear of a suitable one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I see. I thought, perhaps, you might be going to be married.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Miss Debenham did not reply. She raised her eyes and looked Poirot
          full in the face. The glance said plainly: “You are impertinent.”
        </p>
        <p class="p249 ft5">
          “What is your opinion of the lady who shares your
          <nobr>compartment—Miss</nobr> Ohlsson?” “She seems a pleasant, simple
          creature.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“What colour is her <nobr>dressing-gown?”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          Mary Debenham stared. “A kind of brownish
          <nobr>colour—natural</nobr> wool.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Ah! I may mention without indiscretion, I hope, that I noticed the
          colour of your dressing- gown on the way from Aleppo to Stamboul. A
          pale mauve, I believe.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes, that is right.”</p>
        <p class="p367 ft5">
          “Have you any other <nobr>dressing-gown,</nobr> Mademoiselle? A
          scarlet <nobr>dressing-gown,</nobr> for example?” “No, that is not
          mine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p87 ft3">
          Poirot leant forward. He was like a cat pouncing on a mouse. “Whose,
          then?’
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The girl drew back a little, startled. “I don’t know. What do you
          mean?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “You do not say, ‘No, I have no such thing.’ You say, ‘That is not
          mine.’ Meaning that such a thing does belong to someone else.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She nodded.</p>
        <p class="p368 ft5">“Somebody else on this train?” ‘Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Whose is it?”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id80_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_81">
      <div id="id81_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “I told you just now: I don’t know. I woke up this morning about five
          o’clock with the feeling that the train had been standing still for a
          long time. I opened the door and looked out into the corridor,
          thinking we might be at a station. I saw someone in a scarlet kimono
          some way down the corridor.”
        </p>
        <p class="p369 ft3">
          “And you don’t know who it was? Was she fair, or dark, or
          <nobr>grey-haired?”</nobr> “I can’t say. She had on a shingle cap and
          I only saw the back of her head.” “And in build?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Tallish and slim, I should judge, but it’s difficult to say. The
          kimono was embroidered with dragons.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes, yes, that is <nobr>right—dragons.”</nobr> He was silent a
          minute. He murmured to himself. “I cannot understand. I cannot
          understand. None of this makes sense.”
        </p>
        <p class="p214 ft3">
          Then, looking up, he said: “I need not keep you further,
          Mademoiselle.” “Oh!” She seemed rather taken aback but rose promptly.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          In the doorway, however, she hesitated a minute and then came back.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The Swedish <nobr>lady—Miss</nobr> Ohlsson, is
          <nobr>it?—seems</nobr> rather worried. She says you told her she was
          the last person to see this man alive. She thinks, I believe, that you
          suspect her on that account. Can’t I tell her that she has made a
          mistake? Really, you know, she is the kind of creature who wouldn’t
          hurt a fly.” She smiled a little as she spoke.
        </p>
        <p class="p314 ft3">
          “What time was it that she went to fetch the aspirin from Mrs.
          Hubbard?” “Just after <nobr>half-past</nobr> ten.”
        </p>
        <p class="p240 ft5">
          “She was <nobr>away—how</nobr> long?” “About five minutes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p370 ft3">
          “Did she leave the compartment again during the night?” “No.”
        </p>
        <p class="p218 ft5">
          Poirot turned to the doctor. “Could Ratchett have been killed as early
          as that?” The doctor shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Then I think you can reassure your friend, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Thank you.” She smiled suddenly at him, a smile that invited
          sympathy. “She’s like a sheep, you know. She gets anxious and bleats.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She turned and went out.</p>

          THE EVIDENCE OF THE GERMAN <nobr>LADY’S-MAID</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p202 ft3">M. Bouc was looking at his friend curiously.</p>
        <p class="p372 ft3">
          “I do not quite understand you, <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>.
          You were trying to <nobr>do—what?”</nobr> “I was searching for a flaw,
          my friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“A flaw?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“Yes—in</nobr> the armour of a young lady’s
          <nobr>self-possession.</nobr> I wished to shake her
          <nobr><span class="ft4">sang-froid</span>.</nobr> Did I succeed? I do
          not know. But I know this: she did not expect me to tackle the matter
          as I did.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You suspect her,” said M. Bow slowly. “But why? She seems a very
          charming young lady— the last person in the world to be mixed up in a
          crime of this kind.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I agree,” said Constantine. “She is cold. She has not emotions. She
          would not stab a man— she would sue him in the law courts.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot sighed.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You must, both of you, get rid of your obsession that this is an
          unpremeditated and sudden crime. As for the reasons why I suspect Miss
          Debenham, there are two. One is because of something that I overheard,
          and that you do not as yet know.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He retailed to them the curious interchange of phrases he had
          overheard on the journey from Aleppo.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is curious, certainly,” said M. Bouc when he had finished. “It
          needs explaining. If it means what you suspect it means, then they are
          both of them in it <nobr>together—she</nobr> and the stiff
          Englishman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">Poirot nodded.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “And that is just what is not borne out by the facts,” he said. “See
          you, if they were both in this together, what should we expect to
          find? That each of them would provide an alibi for the other. Is not
          that so? But <nobr>no—that</nobr> does not happen. Miss Debenham’s
          alibi is provided by a Swedish woman whom she has never seen before,
          and Colonel Arbuthnot’s alibi is vouched for by MacQueen, the dead
          mans secretary. No, that solution of the puzzle is too easy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p373 ft3">
          “You said there was another reason for your suspicions of her,” M.
          Bouc, reminded him. Poirot smiled.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah! but that is only psychological. I ask myself, is it possible for
          Miss Debenham to have planned this crime? Behind this business, I am
          convinced, there is a cool, intelligent, resourceful brain. Miss
          Debenham answers to that description.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc shook his head. “I think you are wrong, my friend. I do not
          see that young English girl as a criminal.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah! Well,” said Poirot, picking up the last passport. “To the final
          name on our list. Hildegarde Schmidt, <nobr>lady’s-maid.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Summoned by the attendant, Hildegarde Schmidt came into the restaurant
          car and stood waiting respectfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot motioned her to sit down.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She did so, folding her hands and waiting placidly till he questioned
          her. She seemed a placid creature
          <nobr>altogether—eminently</nobr> respectable, perhaps not
          <nobr>over-intelligent.</nobr>

      <div id="id83_1">
        <p class="p219 ft3">
          Poirot’s methods with Hildegarde Schmidt were a complete contrast to
          his handling of Mary Debenham.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          He was at his kindest and most genial, setting the woman at her ease.
          Then, having got her to write down her name and address, he slid
          gently into his questions.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">The interview took place in German.</p>
        <p class="p81 ft5">
          “We want to know as much as possible about what happened last night,”
          he said. “We know that you cannot give us much information bearing on
          the crime itself, but you may have seen or heard something that, while
          conveying nothing to you, may be valuable to us. You understand?” She
          did not seem to. Her broad, kindly face remained set in its expression
          of placid stupidity
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">as she answered:</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I do not know anything, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p214 ft3">
          “Well, for instance you know that your mistress sent for you last
          night.” “That, yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Do you remember the time?”</p>
        <p class="p374 ft5">
          “I do not, Monsieur. I was asleep, you see, when the attendant came
          and told me.” “Yes, yes. Was it usual for you to be sent for in this
          way?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It was not unusual, Monsieur. The gracious lady often required
          attention at night. She did not sleep well.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Eh bien</span>, then, you received the summons and
          you got up. Did you put on a <nobr>dressing-gown?”</nobr> “No,
          Monsieur, I put on a few clothes. I would not like to go in to her
          Excellency in my
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3"><nobr>dressing-gown.”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “And yet it is a very nice <nobr>dressing-gown—scarlet,</nobr> is it
          not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She stared at him. “It is a dark blue flannel
          <nobr>dressing-gown,</nobr> Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah! continue. A little pleasantry on my part, that is all. So you
          went along to Madame la Princesse. And what did you do when you got
          there?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I gave her massage, Monsieur, and then I read aloud. I do not read
          aloud very well, but her Excellency says that is all the
          <nobr>better—so</nobr> it sends her better to sleep. When she became
          sleepy, Monsieur, she told me to go, so I closed the book and I
          returned to my own compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p375 ft3">
          “Do you know what time that was?” “No, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p376 ft5">
          “Well, how long had you been with Madame la Princesse?” “About half an
          hour, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Good, continue.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “First, I fetched her Excellency an extra rug from my compartment. It
          was very cold in spite of the heating. I arranged the rug over her,
          and she wished me good night. I poured her out some mineral water.
          Then I turned out the light and left her.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And then?”</p>
        <p class="p377 ft3">
          “There is nothing more, Monsieur. I returned to my carriage and went
          to sleep.” “And you met no one in the corridor?”

        <p class="p5 ft5">“No, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You did not, for instance, see a lady in a scarlet kimono with
          dragons on it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Her mild eyes bulged at him. “No, indeed, Monsieur. There was nobody
          about except the attendant. Everyone was asleep.”
        </p>
        <p class="p344 ft5">
          “But you did see the conductor?” “Yes, Monsieur.”

          “He came out of one of the compartments, Monsieur.” “What?” M. Bouc
          leaned forward. “Which one?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Hildegarde Schmidt looked frightened again, and Poirot cast a
          reproachful glance at his friend.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft23">
          “Naturally,” he said. “The conductor often has to answer bells at
          night. Do you remember which compartment it was?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It was about the middle of the coach, Monsieur. Two or three doors
          from Madame la Princesse.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          “Ah! tell us, if you please, exactly where this was and what
          happened?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “He nearly ran into me, Monsieur. It was when I was returning from my
          compartment to that of the Princess with the rug.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And he came out of a compartment and almost collided with you. In
          which direction was he going?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “Towards me, Monsieur. He apologised and passed on down the corridor
          towards the dining- car. A bell began ringing, but I do not think he
          answered it.” She paused and then said: “I do not understand. How is
          <nobr>it—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot spoke reassuringly.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is just a question of time,” he said. “All a matter of routine.
          This poor conductor, he seems to have had a busy
          <nobr>night—first</nobr> waking you and then answering bells.”
        </p>
        <p class="p287 ft3">
          “It was not the same conductor who woke me, Monsieur. It was another
          one.” “Ah! another one! Had you seen him before?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“No, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p229 ft5">
          <nobr>“Ah!—do</nobr> you think you would recognise him if you saw
          him?” “I think so, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Poirot murmured something in M. Bouc’s ear. The latter got up and went
          to the door to give an order.
        </p>
        <p class="p188 ft5">
          Poirot was continuing his questions in an easy, friendly manner. “Have
          you ever been to America, Fräulein Schmidt?” “Never, Monsieur. It must
          be a fine country.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You have heard, perhaps, who this man who was killed really
          <nobr>was—that</nobr> he was responsible for the death of a little
          child?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Yes, I have heard, Monsieur. It was
          <nobr>abominable—wicked.</nobr> The good God should not allow such
          things. We are not so wicked as that in Germany.”
        </p>
        <p class="p218 ft5">
          Tears had come into the woman’s eyes. Her strong, motherly soul was
          moved. “It was an abominable crime,” said Poirot gravely.
        </p>
        <p class="p225 ft3">
          He drew a scrap of cambric from his pocket and handed it to her. “Is
          this your handkerchief, Fräulein Schmidt?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          There was a moment’s silence as the woman examined it. She looked up
          after a minute. The colour had mounted a little in her face.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Ah! no, indeed. It is not mine, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It has the initial H, you see. That is why I thought it was yours.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Ah! Monsieur, it is a lady’s handkerchief, that. A very expensive
          handkerchief. Embroidered by hand. It comes from Paris, I should say.”
        </p>
        <p class="p364 ft5">
          “It is not yours and you do not know whose it is?” “I? Oh! no,
          Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Of the three listening, only Poirot caught the nuance of hesitation in
          the reply.

          M. Bouc whispered in his ear. Poirot nodded and said to the woman:
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “The three <nobr>sleeping-car</nobr> attendants are coming in. Will
          you be so kind as to tell me which is the one you met last night as
          you were going with the rug to the Princess?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The three men entered. Pierre Michel, the big blond conductor of the
          <nobr>Athens-Paris</nobr> coach, and the stout burly conductor of the
          Bucharest one.
        </p>
        <p class="p379 ft3">
          Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them and immediately shook her head. “No,
          Monsieur,” she said. “None of these is the man I saw last night.” “But
          these are the only conductors on the train. You must be mistaken.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I am quite sure, Monsieur. These are all tall, big men. The one I saw
          was small and dark. He had a little moustache. His voice when he said
          ‘<span class="ft22">Pardon</span>’ was weak, like a woman’s. Indeed, I
          remember him very well, Monsieur.”

          “A small dark man with a womanish voice,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The three conductors and Hildegarde Schmidt had been dismissed.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc made a despairing gesture. “But I understand
          <nobr>nothing—but</nobr> nothing, of all of this! The enemy that this
          Ratchett spoke of, he was then on the train after all? But where is he
          now? How can he have vanished into thin air? My head, it whirls. Say
          something, then, my friend, I implore you. Show me how the impossible
          can be possible!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft23">
          “It is a good phrase that,” said Poirot. “The impossible cannot have
          happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of
          appearances.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Explain to me, then, quickly, what actually happened on the train
          last night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I am not a magician, <span class="ft4">mon cher</span>. I am, like
          you, a very puzzled man. This affair advances in a very strange
          manner.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It does not advance at all. It stays where it was.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot shook his head. “No, that is not true. We are more advanced. We
          know certain things. We have heard the evidence of the passengers.”
        </p>
        <p class="p381 ft3">
          “And what has that told us? Nothing at all.” “I would not say that, my
          friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I exaggerate, perhaps. The American Hardman, and the German
          <nobr>maid—yes,</nobr> they have added something to our knowledge.
          That is to say, they have made the whole business more unintelligible
          than it was.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, no, no,” said Poirot soothingly.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          M. Bouc turned upon him. “Speak, then, let us hear the wisdom of
          Hercule Poirot.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Did I not tell you that I was, like you, a very puzzled man? But at
          least we can face our problem. We can arrange such facts as we have
          with order and method.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Pray continue, Monsieur,” said Dr. Constantine.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot cleared his throat and straightened a piece of
          <nobr>blotting-paper.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Let us review the case as it stands at this moment. First, there are
          certain indisputable facts. This man, Ratchett or Cassetti, was
          stabbed in twelve places and died last night. That is fact one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p382 ft3">
          “I grant it <nobr>you—I</nobr> grant it,
          <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>,” said M. Bouc with a gesture of
          irony. Hercule Poirot was not at all put out. He continued calmly.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I will pass over for the moment certain rather peculiar appearances
          which Dr. Constantine and I have already discussed together. I will
          come to them presently. The next fact of importance, to my mind, is
          the <span class="ft4">time </span>of the crime.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That, again, is one of the few things we do know,” said M. Bouc. “The
          crime was committed at a quarter past one this morning. Everything
          goes to show that that was so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Not <span class="ft22">everything</span>. You exaggerate. There is,
          certainly, a fair amount of evidence to support that view.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“I am glad you admit that at least.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot went on calmly, unperturbed by the interruption. “We have
          before us three possibilities.

          <nobr>“(1)—that</nobr> the crime was committed, as you say, at a
          quarter past one. This is supported by the evidence of the watch, by
          the evidence of Mrs. Hubbard, and by the evidence of the German woman,
          Hildegarde Schmidt. It agrees with the evidence of Dr. Constantine.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          <nobr>“(2)—that</nobr> the crime was committed
          <span class="ft4">later</span>, and that the evidence of the watch was
          deliberately faked in order to mislead.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          <nobr>“(3)—that</nobr> the crime was committed
          <span class="ft22">earlier</span>, and the evidence faked for the same
          reason as above.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “Now if we accept possibility (1) as the most likely to have occurred,
          and the one supported by most evidence, we must also accept certain
          facts arising from it. If the crime was committed at a quarter past
          one, the murderer cannot have left the train, and the questions arise:
          Where is he? And <span class="ft22">who </span>is he?
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “To begin with, let us examine the evidence carefully. We first hear
          of the existence of this <nobr>man—the</nobr> small dark man with a
          womanish <nobr>voice—from</nobr> the man Hardman. He says that
          Ratchett told him of this person and employed him to watch out for the
          man. There is no <span class="ft22">evidence </span>to support this;
          we have only Hardman’s word for it. Let us next examine the question:
          Is Hardman the person he pretends to be an operative of a New York
          detective agency?
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What to my mind is so interesting in this case is that we have none
          of the facilities afforded to the police. We cannot investigate the
          <span class="ft22">bona fides </span>of any of these people. We have
          to rely solely on deduction. That, to me, makes the matter very much
          more interesting. There is no routine work. It is all a matter of the
          intellect. I ask myself: Can we accept Hardman’s account of himself? I
          make my decision and I answer ‘Yes.’ I am of the opinion that we
          <span class="ft22">can </span>accept Hardman’s account of himself.”
        </p>
        <p class="p383 ft3">
          “You rely on the intuition? What the Americans call ‘the hunch’?”
          asked Dr. Constantine. “Not at all. I regard the probabilities.
          Hardman is travelling with a false <nobr>passport—that</nobr> will at
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft5">
          once make him an object of suspicion. The first thing that the police
          will do when they do arrive upon the scene is to detain Hardman and
          cable as to whether his account of himself is true. In the case of
          many of the passengers, to establish their
          <span class="ft4">bona fides </span>will be difficult; in most cases
          it will probably not be attempted, especially since there seems
          nothing in the way of suspicion attaching to them. But in Hardman’s
          case it is simple. Either he is the person he represents himself to
          be, or he is not. Therefore I say that all will prove to be in order.”
        </p>
        <p class="p348 ft3">“You acquit him of suspicion?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Not at all. You misunderstand me. For all I know, any American
          detective might have his own private reasons for wishing to murder
          Ratchett. No, what I am saying is that I think we
          <span class="ft4">can </span>accept Hardman’s own account of
          <span class="ft4">himself</span>. This story, then, that he tells of
          Ratchett’s seeking him out and employing him is not unlikely, and is
          most <nobr>probably—though</nobr> not of course
          <nobr>certainly—true.</nobr> If we are going to accept it as true, we
          must see if there is any confirmation of it. We find it in rather an
          unlikely <nobr>place—in</nobr> the evidence of Hildegarde Schmidt. Her
          description of the man she saw in Wagon Lit uniform tallies exactly.
          Is there any further confirmation of these two stories? There is.
          There is the button that Mrs. Hubbard found in her compartment. And
          there is also another corroborating statement which you may not have
          noticed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p384 ft3">“What is that?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “The fact that both Colonel Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen mention that
          the conductor passed their carriage. They attached no importance to
          the fact, but, Messieurs,

          “Therefore this story, the story of a small dark man with a womanish
          voice dressed in Wagon Lit uniform, rests on the testimony, direct or
          indirect, of four witnesses.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “One small point,” said Dr. Constantine. “If Hildegarde Schmidt’s
          story is true, how is it that the real conductor did not mention
          having seen her when he came to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s bell?”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “That is explained, I think. When he arrived to answer Mrs. Hubbard,
          the maid was in with her mistress. When she finally returned to her
          own compartment, the conductor was in with Mrs. Hubbard.”

          M. Bouc had been waiting with difficulty until they had finished.

          “Yes, yes, my friend,” he said impatiently to Poirot. “But whilst I
          admire your caution, your method of advancing a step at a time, I
          submit that you have not yet touched the point at issue. We are all
          agreed that this person exists. The point is,
          <span class="ft22">where did he go</span>?”

        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot shook his head reprovingly.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You are in error. You are inclined to put the cart before the horse.
          Before I ask myself, ‘<span class="ft4"
            >Where did this man vanish to</span
          >?’ I ask myself, ‘<span class="ft4">Did such a man really exist</span
          >?’ Because, you see, if the man were an <nobr>invention—a</nobr>
          <nobr>fabrication—how</nobr> much easier to make him disappear! So I
          try to establish first that there really
          <span class="ft4">is </span>such a
          <nobr>flesh-and-blood</nobr> person.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “And having arrived at the fact that there
          <nobr>is—<span class="ft22">eh</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> bien</span>, where is he now?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “There are only two answers to that,
          <span class="ft4">mon cher</span>. Either he is still hidden on the
          train in a place of such extraordinary ingenuity that we cannot even
          think of it; or else he is, as one might say,
          <span class="ft4">two persons</span>. That is, he is both
          <nobr>himself—the</nobr> man feared by M. <nobr>Ratchett—and</nobr> a
          passenger on the train so well disguised that M. Ratchett did not
          recognise him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is an idea, that,” said M. Bouc, his face lighting up. Then it
          clouded over again. “But there is one <nobr>objection—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot took the words out of his mouth.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “The height of the man. It is that you would say? With the exception
          of Mr. Ratchett’s valet, all the passengers are big
          <nobr>men—the</nobr> Italian, Colonel Arbuthnot, Hector MacQueen,
          Count Andrenyi. Well, that leaves us the <nobr>valet—not</nobr> a very
          likely supposition. But there is another possibility. Remember the
          ‘womanish’ voice. That gives us a choice of alternatives. The man may
          be disguised as a woman, or, alternatively, he may actually
          <span class="ft22">be </span>a woman. A tall woman dressed in men’s
          clothes would look small.”
        </p>
        <p class="p385 ft3">
          “But surely Ratchett would have <nobr>known—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Perhaps he <span class="ft22">did </span>know. Perhaps, already, this
          woman had attempted his life, wearing a mares clothes the better to
          accomplish her purpose. Ratchett may have guessed that she would use
          the same trick again, so he tells Hardman to look for a man. But he
          mentions, however, a womanish voice.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          “It is a possibility,” said M. Bouc. <nobr>“But—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Listen, my friend, I think that I should now tell you of certain
          inconsistencies noticed by Dr. Constantine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He retailed at length the conclusions that he and the doctor had
          arrived at together from the nature of the dead man’s wounds. M. Bouc
          groaned and held his head again. “I know,” said Poirot
          sympathetically. “I know exactly how you feel. The head spins, does it
          not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“The whole thing is a fantasy!” cried M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Exactly. It is <nobr>absurd—improbable—it</nobr> cannot be. So I
          myself have said. And yet, my friend,
          <span class="ft22">there it is</span>! One cannot escape from the
          facts.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It is madness!”</p>

      <div id="id89_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “Is it not? It is so mad, my friend, that sometimes I am haunted by
          the sensation that really it must be very simple. ... But that is only
          one of my ‘little ideas’!”
        </p>
        <p class="p172 ft3">
          “Two murderers,” groaned M. Bouc. “And on the Orient
          <nobr>Express—”</nobr> The thought almost made him weep.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And now let us make the fantasy more fantastic,” said Poirot
          cheerfully. “Last night on the train, there are two mysterious
          strangers. There is the Wagon Lit attendant answering to the
          description given us by M. Hardman, and seen by Hildegarde Schmidt,
          Colonel Arbuthnot and M. MacQueen. There is also a woman in a red
          <nobr>kimono—a</nobr> tall slim woman, seen by Pierre Michel, Miss
          Debenham, M. MacQueen and myself (and smelt, I may say, by Colonel
          Arbuthnot!). Who was she? No one on the train admits to having a
          scarlet kimono. She, too, has vanished. Was she one and the same with
          the spurious Wagon Lit attendant? Or was she some quite distinct
          personality? Where are they, these two? And incidentally, where are
          the Wagon Lit uniform and the scarlet kimono?”
        </p>
        <p class="p203 ft3">
          “Ah! that is something definite.” M. Bouc sprang up eagerly. “We must
          search all the passengers’ luggage. Yes, that will be something.”
        </p>
        <p class="p386 ft3">
          Poirot rose also. “I will make a prophecy,” he said. “You know where
          they are?”
        </p>
        <p class="p387 ft5">“I have a little idea.” “Where, then?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You will find the scarlet kimono in the baggage of one of the men,
          and you will find the uniform of the Wagon Lit conductor in the
          baggage of Hildegarde Schmidt.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Hildegarde Schmidt? You <nobr>think—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Not what you are thinking. I will put it like this. If Hildegarde
          Schmidt is guilty, the uniform may be found in her baggage. But if she
          is innocent, it <span class="ft4">certainly </span>will be.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “But <nobr>how—”</nobr> began M. Bouc and stopped. “What is this noise
          that approaches?” he cried. “It resembles a locomotive in motion.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The noise drew nearer. It consisted of shrill cries and protests in a
          woman’s voice. The door at the end of the
          <nobr>dining-car</nobr> burst open. Mrs. Hubbard burst in.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It’s too horrible!” she cried. It’s just too horrible. In my
          <nobr>sponge-bag.</nobr> My <nobr>sponge-bag!</nobr> A great
          <nobr>knife—all</nobr> over blood?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          And suddenly toppling forward, she fainted heavily on M. Bouc’s
          shoulder.

        <p class="p388 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE WEAPON</p>
        <p class="p159 ft3">
          With more vigour than chivalry, A Bouc deposited the fainting lady
          with her head on the table. Dr. Constantine yelled for one of the
          restaurant attendants, who came at a run.
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “Keep her head so,” said the doctor. “If she revives give her a little
          cognac. You understand?” Then he hurried off after the other two. His
          interest lay wholly in the <nobr>crime—swooning</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">
          <nobr>middle-aged</nobr> ladies did not interest him at all.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          It is possible that Mrs. Hubbard revived rather more quickly by these
          methods than she might otherwise have done. A few minutes later she
          was sitting up, sipping cognac from a glass proffered by the
          attendant, and talking once more.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I just can’t tell you how terrible it was! I don’t suppose anybody on
          this train can understand my feelings. I’ve always been very, very
          sensitive ever since I was a child. The mere sight of
          <nobr>blood—<span class="ft22">ugh</span>!</nobr> Why, even now I get
          faint when I think about it!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The attendant proffered the glass again. “<span class="ft22"
            >Encore un peu, Madame</span
          >?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “D’you think I’d better? I’m a lifelong teetotaller. I never touch
          spirits or wine at any time. All my family are abstainers. Still,
          perhaps as this is only <nobr>medicinal—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She sipped once more.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          In the meantime Poirot and M. Bouc, closely followed by Dr.
          Constantine, had hurried out of the restaurant car and along the
          corridor of the Stamboul coach towards Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          Every traveller on the train seemed to be congregated outside the
          door. The conductor, a harassed look on his face, was keeping them
          back.
        </p>
        <p class="p389 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mais il n’y a rien à voir</span>,” he said, and
          repeated the sentiment in several other languages. “Let me pass if you
          please,” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Squeezing his rotundity past the obstructing passengers he entered the
          compartment, Poirot close behind him.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I am glad you have come, Monsieur,” said the conductor with a sigh of
          relief. “Everyone has been trying to enter. The American
          <nobr>lady—such</nobr> screams as she
          <nobr>gave—<span class="ft4">ma</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft4"> foi</span>, I thought she too had been murdered! I
          came at a run, and there she was screaming like a mad woman; and she
          cried out that she must fetch you, and she departed screeching at the
          top of her voice and telling everybody whose carriage she passed what
          had occurred.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          He added, with a gesture of the hand: “<span class="ft22">It </span>is
          in there, Monsieur. I have not touched it.” Hanging on the handle of
          the door that gave access to the next compartment was a large-
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft5">
          checked rubber <nobr>sponge-bag.</nobr> Below it on the floor, just
          where it had fallen from Mrs. Hubbard’s hand, was a
          <nobr>straight-bladed</nobr> <nobr>dagger—a</nobr> cheap affair, sham
          Oriental with an embossed hilt and a tapering blade. The blade was
          stained with patches of what looked like rust.
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">Poirot picked it up delicately.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes,” he murmured. “There is no mistake. Here is our missing weapon
          all <nobr>right—eh,</nobr> doctor?”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">The doctor examined it.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You need not be so careful,” said Poirot. “There will be no
          fingerprints on it save those of Mrs. Hubbard.” Constantine’s
          examination did not take long.

    <div id="page_91">
      <div id="id91_1">
        <p class="p390 ft3">
          “It is the weapon all right,” he said. “It would account for any of
          the wounds.” “I implore you, my friend, do not say that!” The doctor
          looked astonished.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Already we are heavily overburdened by coincidence. Two people
          decided to stab M. Ratchett last night. It is too much of a good thing
          that both of them should select the same weapon.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “As, to that, the coincidence is not perhaps so great as it seems,”
          said the doctor. “Thousands of these sham Eastern daggers are made and
          shipped to the bazaars of Constantinople.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You console me a little, but only a little,” said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He looked thoughtfully at the door in front of him, then, lifting off
          the <nobr>sponge-bag,</nobr> he tried the handle. The door did not
          budge. About a foot above the handle was the door bolt. Poirot drew it
          back and tried again, but still the door remained fast.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “We locked it from the other side, you remember,” said the doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is true,” said Poirot absently. He seemed to be thinking about
          something else. His brow was furrowed as though in perplexity.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It agrees, does it not?” said M. Bouc. “The man passes through this
          carriage. As he shuts the communicating door behind him he feels the
          <nobr>sponge-bag.</nobr> A thought comes to him and he quickly slips
          the <nobr>blood-stained</nobr> knife inside. Then, all unwitting that
          he has awakened Mrs. Hubbard, he slips out through the other door into
          the corridor.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “As you say,” murmured Poirot. “That is how it must have happened.”
          But the puzzled look did not leave his face.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But what is it?” demanded M. Bouc. “There is something, is there not,
          that does not satisfy you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">Poirot darted a quick took at him.</p>
        <p class="p249 ft5">
          “The same point does not strike you? No, evidently not. Well, it is a
          small matter.” The conductor looked into the carriage. “The American
          lady is coming back.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Dr. Constantine looked rather guilty. He had, he felt, treated Mrs.
          Hubbard rather cavalierly. But she had no reproaches for him. Her
          energies were concentrated on another matter.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I’m going to say one thing right out,” she said breathlessly as she
          arrived in the doorway. “I’m not going on any longer in this
          compartment! Why, I wouldn’t sleep in it <nobr>to-night</nobr> if you
          paid me a million dollars.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“But, <nobr>Madame—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I know what you are going to say, and I’m telling you right now that
          I won’t do any such thing! Why, I’d rather sit up all night in the
          corridor.” She began to cry. “Oh, if my daughter could only
          <nobr>know—if</nobr> she could see me now, <nobr>why—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot interrupted firmly.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You misunderstand, Madame. Your demand is most reasonable. Your
          baggage shall be changed at once to another compartment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Mrs. Hubbard lowered her handkerchief. “is that so? Oh! I feel better
          right away. But surely it’s all full, unless one of the
          <nobr>gentlemen—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc spoke.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Your baggage, Madame, shall be moved out of this coach altogether.
          You shall have a compartment in the next coach, which was put on at
          Belgrade.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Why, that’s splendid. I’m not an extra nervous woman, but to sleep in
          that compartment next door to a dead man!” She shivered. “It would
          drive me plumb crazy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Michel,” called M. Bouc. “Move this baggage into a vacant compartment
          in the <nobr>Athens-Paris</nobr> coach.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id91_2"></div>

    <div id="page_92">
      <div id="id92_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">
          “Yes, Monsieur. The same one as <nobr>this—the</nobr> No. 3?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No,” said Poirot before his friend could reply. “I think it would be
          better for Madame to have a different number altogether. The No. 12,
          for instance.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">“</span>Bien, Monsieur<span class="ft3">.”</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p391 ft5">
          The conductor seized the luggage. Mrs. Hubbard turned gratefully to
          Poirot. “That’s very kind and delicate of you. I appreciate it, I
          assure you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Do not mention it, Madame. We will come with you and see you
          comfortably installed.” Mrs. Hubbard was escorted by the three men to
          her new home. She looked round her happily.
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft5">“This is fine.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “It suits you, Madame? It is, you see, exactly like the compartment
          you have left.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That’s <nobr>so—only</nobr> it faces the other way. But that doesn’t
          matter, for these trains go first one way and then the other. I said
          to my daughter, ‘I want a carriage facing the engine.’ and she said,
          ‘Why, Mamma, that’ll be no good to you, for if you go to sleep one
          way, when you wake up, the train’s going the other!’ And it was quite
          true what she said. Why, last evening we went into Belgrade one way
          and out the other.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “At any rate, Madame, you are quite happy and contented now?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well, no, I wouldn’t say that. Here we are stuck in a snowdrift and
          nobody doing anything about it, and my boat sailing the day after
          <nobr>to-morrow.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Madame,” said M. Bouc, “we are all in the same
          <nobr>case—every</nobr> one of us.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, that’s true,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard. “But nobody else has had a
          murderer walking right through her compartment in the middle of the
          night.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What still puzzles me, Madame,” said Poirot, “is how the man got into
          your compartment if the communicating door was bolted as you say. You
          are sure that it <span class="ft22">was </span>bolted?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Why, the Swedish lady tried it before my eyes.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Let us just reconstruct that little scene. You were lying in your
          <nobr>bunk—so—and</nobr> you could not see for yourself, you say?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, because of the <nobr>sponge-bag.</nobr> Oh! my, I shall have to
          get a new <nobr>sponge-bag.</nobr> It makes me feel sick at my stomach
          to look at this one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Poirot picked up the <nobr>sponge-bag</nobr> and hung it on the handle
          of the communicating door into the next carriage.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Précisément</span>. I see,” he said. “The bolt is
          just underneath the <nobr>handle—the</nobr>
          <nobr>sponge-bag</nobr> masks it. You could not see from where you
          were lying whether the bolt was turned or not.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Why, that’s just what I’ve been telling you!”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “And the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson, stood so, between you and the
          door. She tried it and told you it was bolted.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That’s so.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “All the same, Madame, she may have made an error. You see what I
          mean.” Poirot seemed anxious to explain. “The bolt is just a
          projection of <nobr>metal—so.</nobr> When it is turned to the right,
          the door is locked. When it is left straight, the door is unlocked.
          Possibly she merely tried the door, and as it was locked on the other
          side she may have assumed that it was locked on your side.”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          “Well, I guess that would be rather stupid of her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p314 ft3">
          “Madame, the most kind, the most amiable, are not always the
          cleverest.” “That’s so, of course.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “By the way, Madame, did you travel out to Smyrna this way?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “No. I sailed right to Stamboul, and a friend of my daughter’s, Mr.
          Johnson (a perfectly lovely man, I’d like to have you know him), met
          me and showed me all round Stamboul. But it was a

          those mosques, and putting on those great shuffling things over your
          <nobr>shoes—where</nobr> was I?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You were saying that Mr. Johnson met you.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That’s so, and he saw me on board a French Messageries boat for
          Smyrna, and my daughter’s husband was waiting right on the quay. What
          he’ll say when he hears about all this! My daughter said this would be
          just the safest, easiest way imaginable. ‘You just sit in your
          carriage,’ she said, ‘and you land right in Parrus, and there the
          American Express will meet you.’ And, oh, dear, what am I to do about
          cancelling my steamship passage? I ought to let them know. I can’t
          possibly make it now. This is just too <nobr>terrible—”</nobr>

        <p class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard showed signs of tears once more.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot, who had been fidgeting slightly, seized his opportunity.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You have had a shock, Madame. The restaurant attendant shall be
          instructed to bring you along some tea and some biscuits.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I don’t know that I’m so set on tea,” said Mrs. Hubbard tearfully.
          “That’s more an English habit.”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          “Coffee, then, Madame. You need some <nobr>stimulant—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p392 ft3">
          “That cognac’s made my head feel mighty funny. I think I would like
          some coffee.” “Excellent. You must revive your forces.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“My, what a funny expression!”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But first, Madame, a little matter of routine. You permit that I make
          a search of your baggage!”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">“What for?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “We are about to commence a search of all the passengers’ luggage. I
          do not want to remind you of an unpleasant experience, but your
          <nobr>sponge-bag—remember.”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          “Mercy! Perhaps you’d better! I just couldn’t bear to get any more
          surprises of that kind.” The examination was quickly over. Mrs.
          Hubbard was travelling with the minimum of
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft3">
          <nobr>luggage—a</nobr> <nobr>hat-box,</nobr> a cheap suitcase, and a
          <nobr>well-burdened</nobr> travelling bag. The contents of all three
          were simple and straightforward, and the examination would not have
          taken more than a couple of minutes had not Mrs. Hubbard delayed
          matters by insisting on due attention being paid to photographs of “my
          daughter” and of two rather ugly <nobr>children—“my</nobr> daughter’s
          children. Aren’t they cunning?”

          Having delivered himself of various polite insincerities, and having
          told Mrs. Hubbard that he would order coffee to be brought to her,
          Poirot was able to take his leave accompanied by his two friends.
        </p>
        <p class="p394 ft3">
          “Well, we have made a start and drawn, a blank,” observed M. Bouc.
          “Whom shall we attack next?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It would be simplest, I think, just to proceed along the train,
          carriage by carriage. That means that we start with No.
          <nobr>16—the</nobr> amiable Mr. Hardman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          Mr. Hardman, who was smoking a cigar, welcomed them affably.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Come right in, gentlemen. That is, if it’s humanly possible. It’s
          just a mite cramped in here for a party.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          M. Bouc explained the object of their visit, and the big detective
          nodded comprehendingly. “That’s O.K. To tell the truth I’ve been
          wondering you didn’t get down to it sooner. Here are
        </p>
        <p class="p106 ft5">
          my keys, gentlemen, and if you like to search my pockets too, why,
          you’re welcome. Shall I reach the grips down for you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“The conductor will do that. Michel!”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The contents of Mr. Hardman’s two “grips” were soon examined and
          passed. They contained, perhaps, an undue proportion of spirituous
          liquor. Mr. Hardman winked.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It’s not often they search your grips at the
          <nobr>frontiers—not</nobr> if you fix the conductor. I handed out a
          wad of Turkish notes right away, and there’s been no trouble so far.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And at Paris?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Mr. Hardman winked again. “By the time I get to Paris,” he said,
          “what’s left over of this little lot will go into a bottle labelled
          hairwash.”
        </p>
        <p class="p395 ft5">
          “You are not a believer in Prohibition, Monsieur Hardman,” said M.
          Bouc with a smile. “Well,” said Hardman, “I can’t say Prohibition has
          ever worried me any.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah!” said M. Bouc. “The speakeasy.” He pronounced the word with care,
          savouring it. “Your American terms are so quaint, so expressive,” he
          said.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Me, I would much like to go to America,” said Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You’d learn a few <nobr>go-ahead</nobr> methods over there,” said
          Hardman. “Europe needs waking up. She’s half asleep.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is true that America is the country of progress,” agreed Poirot.
          “There is much that I admire about Americans. <nobr>Only—I</nobr> am
          perhaps <nobr>old-fashioned—but</nobr> me, I find the American women
          less charming than my own countrywomen. The French or the Belgian
          girl, coquettish, <nobr>charming—I</nobr> think there is no one to
          touch her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Hardman turned away to peer out at the snow for a minute.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Perhaps you’re right, M. Poirot,” he said. “But I guess every nation
          likes its own girls best.” He blinked as though the snow hurt his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Kind of dazzling, isn’t it?” he remarked. “Say, gentlemen, this
          business is getting on my nerves. Murder and the snow and all. And
          nothing <span class="ft4">doing</span>. Just hanging about and killing
          time. I’d like to get busy after someone or something.”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          “The true Western spirit of hustle,” said Poirot with a smile.

        <p class="p77 ft3">
          The conductor replaced the bags and they moved on to the next
          compartment. Colonel Arbuthnot was sitting in a corner smoking a pipe
          and reading a magazine.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot explained their errand. The Colonel made no demur. He had two
          heavy leather suitcases.
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          “The rest of my kit has gone by long sea,” he explained.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Like most Army men the Colonel was a neat packer. The examination of
          his baggage took only a few minutes. Poirot noted a packet of
          <nobr>pipe-cleaners.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “You always use the same kind?” he asked. “Usually. If I can get ’em.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah!” Poirot nodded. These <nobr>pipe-cleaners</nobr> corresponded
          exactly with the one he had found on the floor of the dead man’s
          compartment.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Dr. Constantine remarked as much when they were out in the corridor
          again.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Tout de même</span>,” murmured Poirot, “I can
          hardly believe it. It is not
          <span class="ft22">dans son caractère</span>, and when you have said
          that, you have said everything.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The door of the next compartment was closed. It was that occupied by
          Princess Dragomiroff. They knocked on the door and the Princess’s deep
          voice called “<span class="ft4">Entrez</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p396 ft5">
          M. Bouc was spokesman. He was very deferential and polite as he
          explained their errand. The Princess listened to him in silence, her
          small <nobr>toad-like</nobr> face quite impassive.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “If it is necessary, Messieurs,” she said quietly when he had
          finished, “that is all there is to it. My maid has the keys. She will
          attend to it with you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p397 ft5">
          “Does your maid always carry your keys, Madame?” asked Poirot.
          “Certainly, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And if, during the night at one of the frontiers, the customs
          officials should require a piece of luggage to be opened?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The old lady shrugged her shoulders. “It is very unlikely. But in such
          a case, the conductor would fetch her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You trust her, then, implicitly, Madame?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I have told you so already,” said the Princess quietly. “I do not
          employ people whom I do not trust.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Trust is indeed something in these
          days. It is perhaps better to have a homely woman whom one can trust
          than a more <span class="ft22">chic </span
          ><nobr>maid—for</nobr> example, some smart Parisienne.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          He saw the dark intelligent eyes come slowly round and fasten
          themselves upon his face. “What exactly are you implying, M. Poirot?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Nothing, Madame. I? Nothing.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But yes. You think, do you not, that I should have a smart
          Frenchwoman to attend to my toilet?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “It would be perhaps more usual, Madame.” She shook her head. “Schmidt
          is devoted to me.” Her voice dwelt lingeringly on the words.
          <nobr>“Devotion—<span class="ft22">c’est</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> impayable</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The German woman had arrived with the keys. The Princess spoke to her
          in her own language, telling her to open the valises and help the
          gentlemen in their search. She herself remained in the corridor
          looking out at the snow, and Poirot remained with her, leaving M. Bouc
          to the task of searching the luggage.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She regarded him with a grim smile.</p>
        <p class="p284 ft3">
          “Well, Monsieur, do you not wish to see what my valises contain?” He
          shook his head. “Madame, it is a formality, that is all.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Are you so sure?”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id95_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_96">
      <div id="id96_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">“In your case, yes.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And yet I knew and loved Sonia Armstrong. What do you think, then?
          That I would not soil my hands with killing such
          <span class="ft22">canaille </span>as that man Cassetti? Well, perhaps
          you are right.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She was silent a minute or two. Then she said:</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “With such a man as that, do you know what I should have liked to do?
          I should have liked to call to my servants: ‘Flog this man to death
          and fling him out on the rubbish heap!’ That is the way things were
          done when I was young, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Still he did not speak, just listened attentively.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She looked at him with a sudden impetuosity. “You do not say anything,
          M. Poirot. What is it that you are thinking, I wonder?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He looked at her with a very direct glance. “I think, Madame, that
          your strength is in your <nobr>will—not</nobr> in your arm.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She glanced down at her thin, <nobr>black-clad</nobr> arms ending in
          those <nobr>claw-like</nobr> yellow hands with the rings on the
          fingers.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is true,” she said. “I have no strength in
          <nobr>these—none.</nobr> I do not know whether I am sorry or glad.”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          Then she turned abruptly back towards her carriage where the maid was
          busily packing up the cases.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The Princess cut short M. Bouc’s apologies.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “There is no need for you to apologise, Monsieur,” she said. “A murder
          has been committed. Certain actions have to be performed. That is all
          there is to it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">“</span>Vous êtes bien aimable, Madame<span
            class="ft3"
            >.”</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She inclined her head slightly as they departed.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          The doors of the next two carriages were shut. M. Bouc paused and
          scratched his head.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Diable</span>!” he said. “This may be awkward.
          These are diplomatic passports. Their luggage is exempt.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “From customs examination, yes. But a murder is different.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I know. All the <nobr>same—we</nobr> do not want to have
          complications.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Do not distress yourself, my friend. The Count and Countess will be
          reasonable. See how amiable Princess Dragomiroff was about it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “She is truly <span class="ft22">grande dame</span>. These two are
          also of the same position, but the Count impressed me as a man of
          somewhat truculent disposition. He was not pleased when you insisted
          on questioning his wife. And this will annoy him still further.
          <nobr>Suppose—eh?—we</nobr> omit them. After all, they can have
          nothing to do with the matter. Why should I stir up needless trouble
          for myself?”
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “I do not agree with you,” said Poirot. “I feel sure that Count
          Andrenyi will be reasonable. At any rate let us make the attempt.”
        </p>
        <p class="p133 ft3">
          And before M. Bouc could reply, he rapped sharply on the door of No.
          13. A voice from within cried “<span class="ft22">Entrez</span>!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The Count was sitting in the corner near the door reading a newspaper.
          The Countess was curled up in the opposite corner near the window.
          There was a pillow behind her head and she seemed to have been asleep.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Pardon, Monsieur le Comte,” began Poirot. “pray forgive this
          intrusion. It is that we are making a search of all the baggage on the
          train. In most cases a mere formality. But it has to be done. M. Bouc
          suggests that, as you have a diplomatic passport, you might reasonably
          claim to be exempt from such a search.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id96_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_97">
      <div id="id97_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">The Count considered for a moment.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Thank you,” he said. “But I do not think that I care to have an
          exception made in my case. I should prefer that our baggage should be
          examined like that of the other passengers.”
        </p>
        <p class="p102 ft5">
          He turned to his wife. “You do not object, I hope, Elena?” “Not at
          all,” said the Countess without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          A rapid and somewhat perfunctory search followed. Poirot seemed to be
          trying to mask an embarrassment by making various small pointless
          remarks, such as:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Here is a label all wet on your suitcase, Madame,” as he lifted down
          a blue morocco case with initials on it and a coronet.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          The Countess did not reply to this observation. She seemed, indeed,
          rather bored by the whole proceeding, remaining curled up in her
          corner and staring dreamily out through the window whilst the men
          searched her luggage in the compartment next door.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot finished his search by opening the little cupboard above the
          washbasin and taking a rapid glance at its
          <nobr>contents—a</nobr> sponge, face cream, powder and a small bottle
          labelled trional.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Then with polite remarks on either side, the search party withdrew.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment, that of the dead man, and Poirot’s own
          came next.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          They now came to the <nobr>second-class</nobr> carriages. The first
          one, Nos. 10 and 11, was occupied by Mary Debenham, who was reading a
          book, and Greta Ohlsson, who was fast asleep but woke with a start at
          their entrance.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot repeated his formula. The Swedish lady seemed agitated, Mary
          Debenham calmly indifferent. He addressed himself to the Swedish lady.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “If you permit, Mademoiselle, we will examine your baggage first, and
          then perhaps you would be so good as to see how the American lady is
          getting on. We have moved her into one of the carriages in the next
          coach, but she is still very much upset as the result of her
          discovery. I have ordered coffee to be sent to her, but I think she is
          of those to whom someone to talk to is a necessity of the first
          order.”
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft3">
          The good lady was instantly sympathetic. She would go immediately. It
          must have been indeed a terrible shock to the nerves, and already the
          poor lady was upset by the journey and leaving her daughter. Ah, yes,
          certainly she would go at <nobr>once—her</nobr> case was not
          <nobr>locked—and</nobr> she would take with her some sal ammoniac.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She bustled off. Her possessions were soon examined. They were meagre
          in the extreme. She had evidently not yet noticed the missing wires
          from the <nobr>hat-box.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Miss Debenham had put her book down. She was watching Poirot. When he
          asked her, she handed over her keys. Then, as he lifted down a case
          and opened it, she said:
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Why did you send her away, M. Poirot?”</p>
        <p class="p398 ft5">
          “I, Mademoiselle! Why, to minister to the American lady.” “An
          excellent <nobr>pretext—but</nobr> a pretext all the same.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I don’t understand you, Mademoiselle.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “I think you understand me very well.” She smiled. “You wanted to get
          me alone. Wasn’t that it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">
          “You are putting words into my mouth, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “And ideas into your head? No, I don’t think so. The ideas are already
          there. That is right, isn’t it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">“Mademoiselle, we have a <nobr>proverb—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Qui s’excuse </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft22">s’accuse</span>—is</nobr> that what you were
          going to say? You must give me the credit for a certain amount of
          observation and common sense. For some reason or other you have got it
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="id97_2"></div>

    <div id="page_98">
      <div id="id98_1">
        <p class="p197 ft3">
          into your head that I know something about this sordid
          <nobr>business—this</nobr> murder of a man I never saw before.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You are imagining things, Mademoiselle.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, I am not imagining things at all. But it seems to me that a lot
          of time is wasted by not speaking the <nobr>truth—by</nobr> beating
          about the bush instead of coming straight out with things.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “And you do not like the waste of time. No, you like to come straight
          to the point. You like the direct method.
          <span class="ft4">Eh bien</span>, I will give it to you, the direct
          method. I will ask you the meaning of certain words that I overheard
          on the journey from Syria. I had got out of the train to do what the
          English call ‘stretch the legs’ at the station of Konya. Your voice
          and the Colonel’s, Mademoiselle, they came to me out of the night. You
          said to him, ‘<span class="ft4"
            >Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us</span
          >.’ What <span class="ft4">did </span>you mean by those words,
          Mademoiselle?”
        </p>
        <p class="p399 ft3">
          She asked very quietly, “Do you think I
          <nobr>meant—murder?”</nobr> “It is I who am asking you, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She <nobr>sighed—was</nobr> lost a minute in thought. Then, as though
          rousing herself, she said:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Those words had a meaning, Monsieur, but not one that I can tell you.
          I can only give you my solemn word of honour that I had never set eyes
          on this man Ratchett in my life until I saw him on this train.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          <nobr>“And—you</nobr> refuse to explain those words?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes, if you like to put it that <nobr>way—I</nobr> refuse. They had
          to do <nobr>with—with</nobr> a task I had undertaken.”
        </p>
        <p class="p400 ft3">“A task that is now ended?” “What do you mean?”</p>
        <p class="p401 ft3">
          “It is ended, is it not?” “Why should you think so?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Listen, Mademoiselle, I will recall to you another incident. There
          was a delay to the train on the day we were to reach Stamboul. You
          were very agitated, Mademoiselle. You, so calm, so
          <nobr>self-controlled.</nobr> You lost that calm.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I did not want to miss my connection.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “So you said. But, Mademoiselle, the Orient Express leaves Stamboul
          every day of the week. Even if you had missed the connection it would
          only have been a matter of <nobr>twenty-four</nobr> hours’ delay.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          Miss Debenham for the first time showed signs of losing her temper.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You do not seem to realise that one may have friends awaiting one’s
          arrival in London, and that a day’s delay upsets arrangements and
          causes a lot of annoyance.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Ah, it is like that? There are friends awaiting your arrival? You do
          not want to cause them inconvenience?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Naturally.”</p>
        <p class="p402 ft5">
          “And <nobr>yet—it</nobr> is <nobr>curious—”</nobr> “What is curious?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “On this <nobr>train—again</nobr> we have a delay. And this time a
          more serious delay, since there is no possibility of sending a
          telegram to your friends or of getting them on the
          <nobr>long—the</nobr> <nobr>long—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Long distance? The telephone, you mean.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Ah, yes, the portmanteau call, as you say in England.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Mary Debenham smiled a little in spite of herself. “Trunk call,” she
          corrected. “Yes, as you say, it is extremely annoying not to be able
          to get any word through, either by telephone or by telegraph.”
        </p>

        <p class="p403 ft23">
          “And yet, Mademoiselle, <span class="ft24">this </span>time your
          manner is quite different. You no longer betray the impatience. You
          are calm and philosophical.”
        </p>
        <p class="p404 ft5">
          Mary Debenham flushed and bit her lip. She no longer felt inclined to
          smile. “You do not answer, Mademoiselle?”
        </p>
        <p class="p76 ft3">
          “I am sorry. I did not know that there was anything to answer.” “Your
          change of attitude, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p318 ft5">
          “Don’t you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing, M.
          Poirot?” Poirot spread out his hands in an apologetic gesture.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It is perhaps a fault with us detectives. We expect the behaviour to
          be always consistent. We do not allow for changes of mood.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Mary Debenham made no reply.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You know Colonel Arbuthnot well, Mademoiselle?”</p>
        <p class="p134 ft5">
          He fancied that she was relieved by the change of subject. “I met him
          for the first time on this journey.”
        </p>
        <p class="p152 ft3">
          “Have you any reason to suspect that he may have known this man
          Ratchett?” She shook her head decisively. “I am quite sure he didn’t.”
        </p>
        <p class="p405 ft5">“Why are you sure?” “By the way he spoke.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “And yet, Mademoiselle, we found a <nobr>pipe-cleaner</nobr> on the
          floor of the dead man’s compartment. And Colonel Arbuthnot is the only
          man on the train who smokes a pipe.”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft3">
          He watched her narrowly, but she displayed neither surprise nor
          emotion, merely said: “Nonsense. It’s absurd. Colonel Arbuthnot is the
          last man in the world to be mixed up in a
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">
          <nobr>crime—especially</nobr> a theatrical kind of crime like this.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          It was so much what Poirot himself thought that he found himself on
          the point of agreeing with her. He said instead:
        </p>
        <p class="p406 ft5">
          “I must remind you that you do not know him very well, Mademoiselle.”
          She shrugged her shoulders. “I know the type well enough.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He said very gently:</p>
        <p class="p407 ft5">
          “You still refuse to tell me the meaning of those words: ‘When it’s
          behind us’?” She replied coldly, “I have nothing more to say.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It does not matter,” said Hercule Poirot. “I shall find out.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He bowed and left the compartment, closing the door after him.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Was that wise, my friend?” asked M. Bouc. “You have put her on her
          <nobr>guard—and</nobr> through her, you have put the Colonel on his
          guard also.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mon ami</span>, if you wish to catch a rabbit you
          put a ferret into the hole, and if the rabbit is
          <nobr>there—he</nobr> runs. That is all I have done.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          They entered the compartment of Hildegarde Schmidt.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          The woman was standing in readiness, her face respectful but
          unemotional.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Poirot took a quick glance through the contents of the small case on
          the seat. Then he motioned to the attendant to get down the bigger
          suitcase from the rack.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“The keys?” he said.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“It is not locked, Monsieur.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot undid the hasps and lifted the lid.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Aha!” he said, and turning to M. Bouc, “You remember what I said?
          Look here a little moment!”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft22">

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Ach</span>!” she cried. “That is not mine. I did
          not put it there. I have never looked in that case since we left
          Stamboul. Indeed, indeed, it is true!” She looked from one to another
          of the men pleadingly.
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          Poirot took her gently by the arm and soothed her.

          “No, no, all is well. We believe you. Do not be agitated. I am sure
          you did not hide the uniform there as I am sure that you are a good
          cook. See. You <span class="ft22">are </span>a good cook, are you
          not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Bewildered, the woman smiled in spite of herself, “Yes, indeed, all my
          ladies have said so. <nobr>I—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          She stopped, her mouth open, looking frightened again.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, no,” said Poirot. “I assure you all is well. See, I will tell you
          how this happened. This man, the man you saw in Wagon Lit uniform,
          comes out of the dead man’s compartment. He collides with you. That is
          bad luck for him. He has hoped that no one will see him. What to do
          next? He must get rid of his uniform. It is now not a safeguard, but a
          danger.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          His glance went to M. Bow and Dr. Constantine, who were listening
          attentively.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “There is the snow, you see. The snow which confuses all his plans.
          Where can he hide these clothes? All the compartments are full. No, he
          passes one whose door is open, showing it to be unoccupied. It must be
          the one belonging to the woman with whom he has just collided. He
          slips in, removes the uniform and jams it hurriedly into a suitcase on
          the rack. It may be some time before it is discovered.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“And then?” said M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “That we must discuss,” Poirot said with a warning glance.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He held up the tunic. A button, the third down, was missing. Poirot
          slipped his hand into the pocket and took out a conductor’s
          <nobr>pass-key,</nobr> used to unlock the doors of the compartments.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Here is the explanation of how one man was able to pass through
          locked doors,” said M. Bouc. “Your questions to Mrs. Hubbard were
          unnecessary. Locked or not locked, the man could easily get through
          the communicating door. After all, if a Wagon Lit uniform, why not a
          Wagon Lit key?”
        </p>
        <p class="p153 ft3">“Why not indeed?” returned Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “We might have known it, really. You remember that Michel said that
          the door into the corridor of Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment was locked
          when he came in answer to her bell.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That is so, Monsieur,” said the conductor. “That is why I thought the
          lady must have been dreaming.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “But now it is easy,” continued M. Bouc. “Doubtless he meant to relock
          the communicating door, also, but perhaps he heard some movement from
          the bed and it startled him.”
        </p>
        <p class="p408 ft5">
          “We have now,” said Poirot, “only to find the scarlet kimono.” “True.
          And these last two compartments are occupied by men.” “We will search
          all the same.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Oh! assuredly. Besides, I remember what you said.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Hector MacQueen acquiesced willingly in the search. “I’d just as soon
          you did,” he said with a rueful smile. “I feel I’m definitely the most
          suspicious character on the train. You’ve only got to find a will in
          which the old man left me all his money, and that’ll just about fix
          things.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “That’s only my fun,” added MacQueen hastily. “He’d never have left me
          a cent, really. I was just useful to <nobr>him—languages</nobr> and so
          on. You’re likely to be out of luck, you know, if you don’t

          what I call Shopping and <nobr>Hotel—snappy</nobr> bits in French and
          German and Italian.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His voice was a little louder than usual. It was as though he were
          slightly uneasy over the search in spite of his expressed willingness.
        </p>
        <p class="p133 ft5">
          Poirot emerged. “Nothing,” he said. “Not even a compromising bequest!”
          MacQueen sighed. “Well, that’s a load off my mind,” he said
          humorously.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          They moved on to the last compartment. The examination of the luggage
          of the big Italian and of the valet yielded no result.
        </p>
        <p class="p409 ft5">
          The three men stood at the end of the coach looking at each other.
          “What next?” said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “We will go back to the <nobr>dining-car,”</nobr> said Poirot. “We
          know now all that we can know. We have the evidence of the passengers,
          the evidence of their baggage, the evidence of our eyes. ...
        </p>
        <p class="p410 ft3">
          We can expect no further help. It must be our part now to use our
          brains.” He felt in his pocket for his cigarette case. It was empty.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I will join you in a moment,” he said. “I shall need the cigarettes.
          This is a very difficult, a very curious, affair. Who wore that
          scarlet kimono? Where is it now? I wish I knew. There is something in
          this <nobr>case—some</nobr> <nobr>factor—that</nobr> escapes me! It is
          difficult because it has been <span class="ft4">made </span>difficult.
          But we will discuss it. Pardon me a moment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He went hurriedly along the corridor to his own compartment. He had,
          he knew, a further supply of cigarettes in one of his valises.
        </p>
        <p class="p349 ft5">
          He got it down and snapped back the lock. Then he sat back on his
          heels and stared.
        </p>
        <p class="p411 ft24">
          Neatly folded on the top of the case was a thin scarlet silk kimono
          embroidered with dragons.
          <span class="ft23"
            >“So,” he murmured. “It is like that. A defiance. Very well, I take

        <p class="p159 ft3">
          M. Bouc. and Dr. Constantine were talking together when Poirot entered
          the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> M. Bouc was looking depressed.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Le voilà</span>,” said the latter when he saw
          Poirot. Then he added, as his friend sat down, “If you solve this
          case, <span class="ft4">mon cher</span>, I shall indeed believe in
          miracles!”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“It worries you, this case?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Naturally it worries me. I cannot make head or tail of it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I agree,” said the doctor. He looked at Poirot with interest. “To be
          frank,” he said, “I cannot see what you are going to do next.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No!” said Poirot thoughtfully.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He took out his cigarette case and lit one of his tiny cigarettes. His
          eyes were dreamy.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That, to me, is the interest of this case,” he said. “We are cut off
          from all the normal routes of procedure. Are these people whose
          evidence we have taken speaking the truth, or lying? We have no means
          of finding <nobr>out—except</nobr> such means as we can devise
          ourselves. It is an exercise, this, of the brain.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “That is all very fine,” said M. Bouc. “But what have you to go upon?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I told you just now. We have the evidence of the passengers and the
          evidence of our own eyes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p415 ft3">
          “Pretty <nobr>evidence—that</nobr> of the passengers! It told us just
          nothing at all.” Poirot shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="p411 ft3">
          “I do not agree, my friend. The evidence of the passengers gave us
          several points of interest.” “Indeed,” said M. Bouc sceptically. “I
          did not observe it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p375 ft5">
          “That is because you did not listen.” “Well, tell me, what did I
          miss?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I will just take one <nobr>instance—the</nobr> first evidence we
          heard, that of the young MacQueen. He uttered, to my mind, one very
          significant phrase.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“About the letters?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No, not about the letters. As far as I can remember, his words were:
          ‘<span class="ft4"
            >We travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was
            hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than a

        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He looked from the doctor’s face to that of M. Bouc.

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What? You still do not see? That is <nobr>inexcusable—for</nobr> you

          “Ah, it is that you want it given to you in words of one syllable.
          Well, here it is!
          <span class="ft22">M. Ratchett spoke no French</span>. Yet, when the
          conductor came in answer to his bell last night, it was a voice
          speaking in <span class="ft22">French </span>that told him that it was
          a mistake and that he was not wanted. It was, moreover, a perfectly
          idiomatic phrase that was used, not one that a man knowing only a few
          words of French would have selected. ‘<span class="ft22"
            >Ce n’est rien Je me suis trompé</span
          >.’ ”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is true,” cried Constantine excitedly. “We should have seen that!
          I remember your laying stress on the words when you repeated them to
          us. Now I understand your reluctance to rely upon the evidence of the
          dented watch. Already, at <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one,
          Ratchett was <nobr>dead—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p416 ft23">
          “And it was his murderer speaking!” finished M. Bouc impressively.
          Poirot raised a deprecating hand.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Let us not go too fast. And do not let us assume more than we
          actually know. It is safe, I think, to say that at that
          <nobr>time—twenty-three</nobr> minutes to
          <nobr>one—<span class="ft22">some</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> other person </span>was in Ratchett’s

          French language fluently.”
        </p>
        <p class="p385 ft3">
          “You are very cautious, <span class="ft22">mon </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft22">vieux</span>—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          “One should advance only a step at a time. We have no actual
          <span class="ft22">evidence </span>that Ratchett was dead at that
          time.”
        </p>
        <p class="p417 ft5">
          “There is the cry that awakened you.” “Yes, that is true.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “In one way,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully, “this discovery does not
          affect things very much. You heard someone moving about next door.
          That someone was not Ratchett, but the other man. Doubtless he is
          washing blood from his hands, clearing up after the crime, burning the
          incriminating letter. Then he waits till all is still, and, when he
          thinks it is safe and the coast is clear, he locks and chains
          Ratchett’s door on the inside, unlocks the communicating door through
          into Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment and slips out that way. In fact, it is
          exactly as we thought,
          <span class="ft22"
            >with the difference that Ratchett was killed about half an hour
            earlier </span
          >and the watch put on to a quarter past one to create an alibi.”
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft3">
          “Not such a famous alibi,” said Poirot. “The hands of the watch
          pointed to <nobr>1.15—the</nobr> exact time when the intruder actually
          left the scene of the crime.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “True,” said M. Bouc, a little confused. “What then does the watch
          convey to you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “If the hands were <nobr>altered—I</nobr> say
          <nobr><span class="ft4">if</span>—then</nobr> the time at which they
          were set <span class="ft4">must </span>have a significance. The
          natural reaction would be to suspect anyone who had a reliable alibi
          for the time <nobr>indicated—in</nobr> this case, 1.15.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Yes, yes,” said the doctor. “That reasoning is good.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “We must also pay a little attention to the time the intruder
          <span class="ft22">entered </span>the compartment. When had he an
          opportunity of doing so? Unless we are to assume the complicity of the
          real conductor, there was only one time when he could have done
          <nobr>so—during</nobr> the time the train stopped at Vincovci. After
          the train left Vincovci the conductor was sitting facing the corridor,
          and whereas any one of the passengers would pay little attention to a
          Wagon Lit attendant, the <span class="ft22">one </span>person who
          <span class="ft22">would </span>notice an impostor is the real
          conductor. But during the halt at Vincovci the conductor is out on the
          platform. The coast is clear.”
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft23">
          “And by our former reasoning, it <span class="ft24">must </span>be one
          of the passengers,” said M. Bouc. “We come back to where we were.
          Which of them?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Poirot smiled.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">

          by all means be orderly and methodical.”
        </p>
        <p class="p443 ft5">
          “Assuredly,” said Poirot, nodding his head in a satisfied fashion. M.
          Bouc continued somewhat didactically.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The initial H is connected with three
          <nobr>people—Mrs.</nobr> Hubbard, Miss Debenham, whose second name is
          Hermione, and the maid Hildegarde Schmidt.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Ah! And of those three?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It is difficult to say. But I <span class="ft22">think </span>I
          should vote for Miss Debenham. For all one knows she may be called by
          her second name and not her first. Also there is already some
          suspicion attaching to her. That conversation you overheard,
          <span class="ft22">mon cher</span>, was certainly a little curious,
          and so is her refusal to explain it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft23">
          “As for me, I plump for the American,” said Dr. Constantine. “It is a
          very expensive handkerchief, that; and Americans, as all the world
          knows, do not care what they pay.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“So you both eliminate the maid?” asked Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Yes. As she herself said, it is the handkerchief of a member of the
          upper classes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          And the second <nobr>question—the</nobr>

          else?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “That is more difficult. The English, they do not stab. You are right
          there. I incline to the view that someone else dropped the
          <nobr>pipe-cleaner—and</nobr> did so to incriminate the
          <nobr>long-legged</nobr> Englishman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “As you said, M. Poirot,” put in the doctor, “<span class="ft22"
            >two </span
          >clues is too much carelessness. I agree with M. Bouc. The
          handkerchief was a genuine <nobr>oversight—hence</nobr> none of the
          women will admit that it is hers. The <nobr>pipe-cleaner</nobr> is a
          faked clue. In support of that theory, you notice that Colonel
          Arbuthnot shows no embarrassment and admits freely to smoking a pipe
          and using that type of cleaner.”

          “Question No. <nobr>3—Who</nobr> wore the scarlet kimono!” went on M.
          Bouc. “As to that, I will confess I have not the slightest idea. Have
          you any views on the subject, Dr. Constantine?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“None.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Then we confess ourselves beaten there. The next question has, at any
          rate, possibilities. Who was the man or the woman masquerading in
          Wagon Lit uniform? Well, one can list with certainty a number of
          people that it could not have been. Hardman, Colonel Arbuthnot,
          Foscarelli, Count Andrenyi and Hector MacQueen are all too tall. Mrs.
          Hubbard, Hildegarde Schmidt and Greta Ohlsson are too broad. That
          leaves the valet, Miss Debenham, Princess Dragomiroff and Countess
          <nobr>Andrenyi—and</nobr> none of them sounds likely! Greta Ohlsson in
          one case, and Antonio Foscarelli in the other, both swear that Miss
          Debenham and the valet never left their compartments. Hildegarde
          Schmidt swears that the Princess was in hers, and Count Andrenyi has
          told us that his wife took a sleeping draught. Therefore it seems
          impossible that it can be <nobr>anybody—which</nobr> is absurd!”
        </p>
        <p class="p444 ft3">
          “As our old friend Euclid says,” murmured Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It must be one of those four,” said Dr. Constantine. “Unless it is
          someone from outside who has found a
          <nobr>hiding-place—and</nobr> that we agreed was impossible.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          M. Bouc had passed on to the next question on the list.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “No. <nobr>5—Why</nobr> do the hands of the broken watch point to
          1.15? I can see two explanations of that. Either it was done by the
          murderer to establish an alibi, and afterwards, when he meant to leave
          the compartment, he was prevented by hearing people moving about; or
          <nobr>else—wait—I</nobr> have an idea <nobr>coming—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          The other two waited respectfully while M. Bouc struggled in mental
          agony.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I have it,” he said at last. “It was not the Wagon Lit murderer who
          tampered with the watch! It was the person we have called the Second
          <nobr>Murderer—the</nobr> <nobr>left-handed</nobr>
          <nobr>person—in</nobr> other words the woman in the scarlet kimono.
          She arrives later and moves back the hands of the watch in order to
          make an alibi for herself.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Bravo said Dr. Constantine. “It is well imagined, that.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “In fact,” said Poirot, “she stabbed him in the dark, not realizing
          that he was dead already, but somehow deduced that he had a watch in
          his pyjama pocket, took it out, put back the hands blindly, and gave
          it the requisite dent.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc looked at him coldly. “Have you anything better to suggest,
          yourself?” he asked. “At the <nobr>moment—no,”</nobr> admitted Poirot.
          “All the same,” he went on, “I do not think you have either of you
          appreciated the most interesting point about that watch.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Does question No. 6 deal with it?” asked the doctor. “To that
          <nobr>question—Was</nobr> the murder committed at that time,
          <nobr>1.15?—I</nobr> answer <span class="ft22">No</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I agree,” said M. Bouc. “’Was it earlier?’ is the next question. I
          <nobr>say—Yes!</nobr> You, too, doctor?”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft5">
          The doctor nodded. “Yes, but the question ‘Was it later?’ can also be
          answered in the affirmative. I agree with your theory, M. Bouc, and
          so, I think, does M. Poirot, although he does not wish to commit
          himself. The First Murderer came earlier than 1. 15, but the Second
          Murderer came <span class="ft4">after </span>1.15. And as regards the
          question of <nobr>left-handedness,</nobr> ought we not to take steps
          to ascertain which of the passengers is <nobr>left-handed?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p64 ft3">
          “I have not completely neglected that point,” said Poirot. “You may
          have noticed that I made each passenger write either a signature or an
          address. That is not conclusive, because some people do certain
          actions with the right hand and others with the left. Some write
          <nobr>right-handed,</nobr>

          but play golf <nobr>left-handed.</nobr> Still, it is something. Every
          person questioned took the pen in his or her right
          <nobr>hand—with</nobr> the exception of Princess Dragomiroff, who
          refused to write.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Princess <nobr>Dragomiroff—impossible,”</nobr> said M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I doubt if she would have had the strength to inflict that
          <nobr>left-handed</nobr> blow,” said Dr. Constantine dubiously. ‘That
          particular wound had been inflicted with considerable force.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“More force than a woman could use?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, I would not say that. But I think more force than an elderly
          woman could display, and Princess Dragomiroff’s physique is
          particularly frail.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “It might be a question of the influence of mind over body,” said
          Poirot. “Princess Dragomiroff has great personality and immense
          <nobr>will-power.</nobr> But let us pass from that for the moment.”
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “To questions Nos. 9 and 10? Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed
          by more than one person, and what other explanation of the wounds can
          there be? In my opinion, medically speaking, there can be
          <span class="ft22">no other </span>explanation of those wounds. To
          suggest that one man struck first feebly and then with violence, first
          with the right hand and then with the left, and after an interval of
          perhaps half an hour inflicted fresh wounds on a dead
          <nobr>body—well,</nobr> it does not make sense.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “No,” said Poirot. “It does not make sense. And you think that two
          murderers do make sense?”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">
          “As you yourself have said, what other explanation can there be?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot stared straight ahead of him. “That is what I ask myself,” he
          said. “That is what I never cease to ask myself.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He leaned back in his seat.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “From now on, it is all here.” He tapped himself on the forehead. “We
          have thrashed it all out. The facts are all in front of
          <nobr>us—neatly</nobr> arranged with order and method. The passengers
          have sat here, one by one, giving their evidence. We know all that can
          be <nobr>known—<span class="ft4">from</span></nobr

        <p class="p5 ft3">He gave M. Bouc an affectionate smile.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It has been a little joke between us, has it
          <nobr>not—this</nobr> business of sitting back and
          <span class="ft4">thinking </span>out the truth? Well, I am about to
          put my theory into <nobr>practice—here</nobr> before your eyes. You
          two must do the same. Let us all three close our eyes and

        <p class="p238 ft11">CERTAIN SUGGESTIVE POINTS</p>
        <p class="p202 ft3">
          It was quite a quarter of an hour before anyone spoke.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine had started by trying to obey Poirot’s
          instructions. They had endeavoured to see through a maze of
          conflicting particulars to a clear and outstanding solution.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc’s thoughts had run something as follows:</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Assuredly I must think. But as far as that goes I have already
          thought. ... Poirot obviously thinks that this English girl is mixed
          up in the matter. I cannot help feeling that that is most unlikely.
          ... The English are extremely cold. Probably it is because they have
          no figures. ... But that is not the point. It seems that the Italian
          could not have done <nobr>it—a</nobr> pity. I suppose the English
          valet is not lying when he said the other never left the compartment?
          But why should he! It is not easy to bribe the English; they are so
          unapproachable. The whole thing is most unfortunate. I wonder when we
          shall get out of this. There must be
          <span class="ft22">some </span>rescue work in progress. They are so
          slow in these countries ... it is hours before anyone thinks of doing
          anything. And the police of these countries, they will be most trying
          to deal <nobr>with—puffed</nobr> up with importance, touchy, on their
          dignity. They will make a grand affair of all this. It is not often
          that such a chance comes their way. It will be in all the newspapers.
          ...”
        </p>
        <p class="p203 ft3">
          And from there on, M. Bouc’s thoughts went along a
          <nobr>well-worn</nobr> course which they had already traversed some
          hundred times.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Dr. Constantine’s thoughts ran thus:</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “He is queer, this little man. A genius? Or a crank? Will he solve
          this mystery? <nobr>Impossible—I</nobr> can see no way out of it. It
          is all too confusing. ... Everyone is lying, perhaps. ... But even
          then, that does not help one. If they are all lying, it is just as
          confusing as if they were speaking the truth. Odd about those wounds.
          I cannot understand it. ... It would be easier to understand if he had
          been <nobr>shot—after</nobr> all, the term ‘gunman’ must mean that
          they shoot with a gun. A curious country, America. I should like to go
          there. It is so progressive. When I get home I must get hold of
          Demetrius <nobr>Zagone—he</nobr> has been to America, he has all the
          modern ideas. ... I wonder what Zia is doing at this moment. If my
          wife ever finds <nobr>out—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          His thoughts went on to entirely private matters. ...
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Hercule Poirot sat very still.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">One might have thought he was asleep.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          And then, suddenly, after a quarter of an hour’s complete immobility
          his eyebrows began to move slowly up his forehead. A little sigh
          escaped him. He murmured beneath his breath.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “But after all, why not? And if <nobr>so—why,</nobr> if so, that would
          explain everything.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His eyes opened. They were green like a cat’s. He said softly: “<span
            class="ft22"
            >Eh bien</span
          >. I have thought. And you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">
          Lost in their reflections, both men started violently.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I have thought also,” said M. Bouc, just a shade guiltily. “But I
          have arrived at no conclusion. The elucidation of crime is your
          <span class="ft22">métier</span>, not mine, my friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I, too, have reflected with great earnestness,” said the doctor,
          unblushingly recalling his thoughts from certain pornographic details.
          “I have thought of many possible theories, but not one that really
          satisfies me.”

      <div id="id109_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_110">
      <div id="id110_1">
        <p class="p65 ft3">Poirot nodded amiably. His nod seemed to say:</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Quite right. That is the proper thing to say. You have given me the
          cue I expected.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He sat very upright, threw out his chest, caressed his moustache and
          spoke in the manner of a practised speaker addressing a public
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “My friends, I have reviewed the facts in my mind, and have also gone
          over to myself the evidence of the <nobr>passengers—with</nobr> this
          result: I see, nebulously as yet, a certain explanation that would
          cover the facts as we know them. It is a very curious explanation, and
          I cannot be sure as yet that it is the true one. To find out
          definitely I shall have to make certain experiments.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I would like first to mention certain points which appear to me
          suggestive. Let us start with a remark made to me by M. Bouc in this
          very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on the train.
          He commented on the fact that we were surrounded by people of all
          classes, of all ages, of all nationalities. That is a fact somewhat
          rare at this time of year. The <nobr>Athens-Paris</nobr> and the
          <nobr>Bucharest-Paris</nobr> coaches, for instance, are almost empty.
          Remember also, the passenger who failed to turn up. He is, I think,
          significant. Then there are some minor points that strike me as
          <nobr>suggestive—for</nobr> instance, the position of Mrs. Hubbard’s
          <nobr>sponge-bag,</nobr> the name of Mrs. Armstrong’s mother, the
          detective methods of M. Hardman, the suggestion of M. MacQueen that
          Ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we found, Princess
          Dragomiroff’s Christian name, and a grease spot on a Hungarian
          passport.”
        </p>
        <p class="p101 ft3">The two men stared at him.</p>
        <p class="p445 ft3">
          “Do they suggest anything to you, those points?” asked Poirot. “Not a
          thing,” said M. Bouc frankly.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft22">
          <span class="ft3">“And </span>M. le docteur<span class="ft3">?”</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I do not understand in the least what you are talking of.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc, meanwhile, seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had
          mentioned, was sorting through the passports. With a grunt he picked
          up that of Count and Countess Andrenyi and opened it.
        </p>
        <p class="p153 ft3">“Is this what you mean? This dirty mark?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Yes. It is a fairly fresh grease spot. You notice where it occurs?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “At the beginning of the description of the Count’s
          <nobr>wife—her</nobr> Christian name, to be exact. But I confess that
          I still do not see the point.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I am going to approach it from another angle. Let us go back to the
          handkerchief found at the scene of the crime. As we stated not long
          ago, three people are associated with the letter H: Mrs. Hubbard, Miss
          Debenham and the maid, Hildegarde Schmidt. Now let us regard that
          handkerchief from another point of view. It is, my friends, an
          extremely expensive <nobr>handkerchief—an</nobr>
          <span class="ft22">objet de luxe</span>,
          <nobr>hand-made,</nobr> embroidered in Paris. Which of the passengers,
          apart from the initial, was likely to own such a handkerchief? Not
          Mrs. Hubbard, a worthy woman with no pretensions to reckless
          extravagance in dress. Not Miss <nobr>Debenham—that</nobr> class of
          Englishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief, not an expensive wisp of
          cambric costing perhaps two hundred francs. And certainly not the
          maid. But there <span class="ft22">are </span>two women on the tram
          who would be likely to own such a handkerchief. Let us see if we can
          connect them in any way with the letter H. The two women I refer to
          are Princess <nobr>Dragomiroff—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p444 ft3">
          “Whose Christian name is Natalia,” put in M. Bouc ironically.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Exactly. And her Christian name, as I said just now, is decidedly
          suggestive. The other woman is Countess Andrenyi. And at once
          something strikes <nobr>us—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“<span class="ft22">You</span>!”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="id110_2"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="page_111">
      <div id="id111_1">
        <p class="p99 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Me</span>, then. Her Christian name on her
          passport is disfigured by a blob of grease. just an accident, anyone
          would say. But consider that Christian name. Elena. Suppose that,
          instead of Elena, it were <span class="ft22">Helena</span>. That
          capital H could be turned into a capital E and then run over the small
          <span class="ft22">e </span>next to it quite
          <nobr>easily—and</nobr> then a spot of grease dropped to cover up the
          alteration.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Helena!” cried M. Bouc. “It is an idea, that.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Certainly it is an idea! I look about for any confirmation, however
          slight, of my <nobr>idea—and</nobr> I find it. One of the luggage
          labels on the Countess’s baggage is slightly damp. It is one that
          happens to run over the first initial on top of the case. That label
          has been soaked off and put on again in a different place.”
        </p>
        <p class="p153 ft3">
          “You begin to convince me,” said M. Bouc. “But the Countess
          <nobr>Andrenyi—surely—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Ah, now, <span class="ft22">mon vieux</span>, you must turn yourself
          round and approach an entirely different angle of the case. How was
          this murder intended to appear to everybody? Do not forget that the
          snow has upset all the murderer’s original plan. Let us imagine, for a
          little minute, that there is no snow, that the train proceeded on its
          normal course. What, then, would have happened?
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “The murder, let us say, would still have been discovered in all
          probability at the Italian frontier early this morning. Much of the
          same evidence would have been given to the Italian police. The
          threatening letters would have been produced by M. MacQueen; M.
          Hardman would have told his story; Mrs. Hubbard would have been eager
          to tell how a man passed through her compartment; the button would
          have been found. I imagine that two things only would have been
          different. The man would have passed through Mrs. Hubbard’s
          compartment just before one <nobr>o’clock—and</nobr> the Wagon Lit
          uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You mean?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I mean that the murder was
          <span class="ft22">planned to look like an outside job</span>. It
          would have been presumed that the assassin had left the train at Brod
          where it is timed to arrive at 0.58. Somebody would probably have
          passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in the corridor. The uniform
          would be left in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how
          the trick had been played. No suspicion would have attached to the
          passengers. That, my friends, was how the affair was intended to
          appear to the outside world.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “But the accident to the train changes everything. Doubtless we have
          here the reason why the man remained in the compartment with his
          victim so long. He was waiting for the train to go on. But at last he
          realised that <span class="ft22">the train was not going on</span>.
          Different plans would have to be made. The murderer would now be
          <span class="ft22">known </span>to be still on the train.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Yes, yes,” said M. Bouc impatiently. “I see all that. But where does
          the handkerchief come in?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “I am returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route. To begin with,
          you must realise that the threatening letters were in the nature of a
          blind. They might have been lifted bodily out of an indifferently
          written American crime novel. They are not
          <span class="ft22">real</span>. They are, in fact, simply intended for
          the police. What we have to ask ourselves is: ‘Did they deceive
          Ratchett?’ On the face of it, the answer seems to be No. His
          instructions to Hardman seem to point to a definite ‘private’ enemy,
          of whose identity he was well aware. That is, if we accept Hardman’s
          story as true. But Ratchett certainly received
          <span class="ft22">one </span>letter of a very different
          <nobr>character—the</nobr> one containing a reference to the Armstrong
          baby, a fragment of which we found in his compartment. In case
          Ratchett had not realised it sooner, this was to make sure that he
          understood the reason of the threats against his life. That letter, as
          I have said all along, was <span class="ft22">not </span>intended to
          be found. The murderer’s first care was to destroy it. This, then, was
          the second hitch in his plans. The first was the snow, the second was
          our reconstruction of that fragment.

          a clue which directly incriminates someone whose initial is H, and it
          was dropped there unwittingly by that person.”
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “Exactly,” said Dr. Constantine. “She finds out that she has dropped
          the handkerchief and immediately takes steps to conceal her Christian
          name.”

        <p class="p446 ft3">
          “How fast you go! You arrive at a conclusion much sooner than I would
          permit myself to do.” “Is there any other alternative?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          ‘Certainly there is. Suppose, for instance, that you have committed a
          crime and wish to cast the blame for it on someone else. Well, there
          is on the train a certain person connected intimately with the
          Armstrong <nobr>family—a</nobr> woman. Suppose, then, that you leave
          there a handkerchief belonging to that woman. She will be questioned,
          her connection with the Armstrong family will be brought
          <nobr>out—<span class="ft4">et</span></nobr

        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “But in such a case,” objected the doctor, “the person indicated,
          being innocent, would not take steps to conceal her identity.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ah, really? That is what you think? That is, truly, the opinion of
          the police court. But I know human nature, my friend, and I tell you
          that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for
          murder, the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most
          absurd things. No, no, the grease spot and the changed label do not
          prove <nobr>guilt—they</nobr> only prove that the Countess Andrenyi is
          anxious for some reason to conceal her identity.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What do you think her connection with the Armstrong family can be?
          She has never been in America, she says.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Exactly, and she speaks English with a foreign accent, and she has a
          very foreign appearance which she exaggerates. But it should not be
          difficult to guess who she is. I mentioned just now the name of Mrs.
          Armstrong’s mother. It was ‘Linda Arden,’ and she was a very
          celebrated <nobr>actress—among</nobr> other things a Shakespearean
          actress. Think of <span class="ft22">As You Like It</span>, with the
          Forest of Arden and Rosalind. It was there she got the inspiration for
          her acting name. ‘Linda Arden,’ the name by which she was known all
          over the world, was not her real name. It may have been Goldenberg; it
          is quite likely that she had Central European blood in her
          <nobr>veins—a</nobr> strain of Jewish, perhaps. Many nationalities
          drift to America. I suggest to you, gentlemen, that that young sister
          of Mrs. Armstrong’s, little more than a child at the time of the
          tragedy, was Helena Goldenberg, the younger daughter of Linda Arden,
          and that she married Count Andrenyi when he was an attaché in
          Washington.”
        </p>
        <p class="p447 ft3">
          “But Princess Dragomiroff says that the girl married an Englishman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Whose name she cannot remember! I ask you, my friends, is that really
          likely? Princess Dragomiroff loved Linda Arden as great ladies do love
          great artists. She was godmother to one of the actress’s daughters.
          Would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter? It
          is not likely. No, I think we can safely say that Princess Dragomiroff
          was lying. She knew Helena was on the train, she had seen her. She
          realised at once, as soon as she heard who Ratchett really was, that
          Helena would be suspected. And so, when we question her as to the
          sister, she promptly <nobr>lies—is</nobr> vague, cannot remember, but
          ‘thinks Helena married an <nobr>Englishman’—a</nobr> suggestion as far
          away from the truth as possible.”

          One of the restaurant attendants came through the door at the end and

          “The dinner, Monsieur, shall I serve it? It is ready some little

          The attendant vanished through the doors at the other end. His bell

        <p class="p202 ft3">
          Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc and the doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          The company assembled in the restaurant car was a very subdued one.
          They spoke little. Even the loquacious Mrs. Hubbard was unnaturally
          quiet. She murmured as she sat:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I don’t feel as though I had the heart to eat anything,” and then
          partook of everything offered her, encouraged by the Swedish lady who
          seemed to regard her as a special charge.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Before the meal was served, Poirot had caught the chief attendant by
          the sleeve and murmured something to him. Constantine made a pretty
          good guess as to what the instructions had been when he noticed that
          the Count and Countess Andrenyi were always served last and that at
          the end of the meat there was a delay in making out their bill. It
          therefore came about that the Count and Countess were the last left in
          the restaurant car.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          When they rose at length and moved in the direction of the door,
          Poirot sprang up and followed them.
        </p>
        <p class="p134 ft5">
          “Pardon, Madame, you have dropped your handkerchief.” He was holding
          out to her the tiny monogrammed square.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          She took it, glanced at it, then handed it back to him. “You are
          mistaken, Monsieur, that is not my handkerchief.”
        </p>
        <p class="p163 ft5">
          “Not your handkerchief? Are you sure?” “Perfectly sure, Monsieur.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “And yet, Madame, it has your <nobr>initial—the</nobr> initial H.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The Count made a sudden movement. Poirot ignored him. His eyes were
          fixed on the Countess’s face.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Looking steadily at him she replied:</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I do not understand, Monsieur. My initials are E. A.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “I think not. Your name is <nobr>Helena—not</nobr> Elena. Helena
          Goldenberg, the younger daughter of Linda
          <nobr>Arden—Helena</nobr> Goldenberg, the sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          There was a dead silence for a minute or two. Both the Count and the
          Countess had gone deadly white.
        </p>
        <p class="p448 ft5">
          Poirot said in a gentler tone: “It is of no use denying. That is the
          truth, is it not?” The Count burst out furiously, “I demand, Monsieur,
          by what right <nobr>you—”</nobr> She interrupted him, putting up a
          small hand towards his mouth.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “No, Rudolph. Let me speak. It is useless to deny what this gentleman
          says. We had better sit down and talk the matter out.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Her voice had changed. It still had the southern richness of tone, but
          it had become suddenly more clear cut and incisive. It was, for the
          first time, a definitely American voice.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The Count was silenced. He obeyed the gesture of her hand and they
          both sat down opposite Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Your statement, Monsieur, is quite true,” said the Countess. “I am
          Helena Goldenberg, the younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”
        </p>
        <p class="p95 ft3">
          “You did not acquaint me with that fact this morning, Madame la
          Comtesse.” “No.”

          “In fact, all that your husband and you told me was a tissue of lies.”
          “Monsieur!” cried the Count angrily.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Do not be angry, Rudolph. M. Poirot puts the fact rather brutally,
          but what he says is undeniable.”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft23">
          “I am glad you admit the fact so freely, Madame. Will you now tell me
          your reasons for that, and also for altering your Christian name on
          your passport?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“That was my doing entirely,” put in the Count.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Helena said quietly: “Surely, M. Poirot, you can guess my
          <nobr>reason—our</nobr> reason. This man who was killed is the man who
          murdered my baby niece, who killed my sister, who broke my brother-
          <nobr>in-law’s</nobr> heart. Three of the people I loved best and who
          made up my <nobr>home—my</nobr> world!”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Her voice rang out passionately. She was a true daughter of that
          mother the emotional force of whose acting had moved huge audiences to
          tears.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She went on more quietly.</p>
        <p class="p450 ft5">
          “Of all the people on the train I alone had probably the best motive
          for killing him.” “And you did not kill him, Madame?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I swear to you, M. <nobr>Poirot—and</nobr> my husband
          <nobr>knows—and</nobr> will swear <nobr>also—that</nobr> much as I may
          have been tempted to do so, I never lifted a hand against that man.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I, too, gentlemen.” said the Count. “I give you my word of honour
          that last night Helena never left her compartment. She took a sleeping
          draught exactly as I said. She is utterly and entirely innocent.”
        </p>
        <p class="p451 ft3">
          Poirot looked from one to the other of them. “On my word of honour,”
          repeated the Count. Poirot shook his head slightly.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “And yet you took it upon yourself to alter the name in the passport?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Monsieur Poirot,” the Count said earnestly and passionately,
          “consider my position. Do you think I could stand the thought of my
          wife dragged through a sordid police case? She was innocent, I knew
          it, but what she said was <nobr>true—because</nobr> of her connection
          with the Armstrong family she would have been immediately suspected.
          She would have been <nobr>questioned—attested,</nobr> perhaps. Since
          some evil chance had taken us on the same train as this man Ratchett,
          there was, I felt sure, but one thing for it. I admit, Monsieur, that
          I lied to <nobr>you—all,</nobr> that is, save in one thing. My wife
          never left her compartment last night.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He spoke with an earnestness that it was hard to gainsay.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I do not say that I disbelieve you, Monsieur,” said Poirot slowly.
          “Your family is, I know, a proud and ancient one. It would be bitter
          indeed for you to have your wife dragged into an unpleasant police
          case. With that I can sympathise. But how then do you explain the
          presence of your wife’s handkerchief actually in the dead man’s
          compartment?”
        </p>
        <p class="p452 ft5">
          “That handkerchief is not mine, Monsieur,” said the Countess. “In
          spite of the initial H?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “In spite of the initial. I have handkerchiefs not unlike that, but
          not one that is exactly of that pattern. I know, of course, that I
          cannot hope to make you believe me, but I assure you that it is so.
          That handkerchief is not mine.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It may have been placed there by someone in order to incriminate
          you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          She smiled a little. “You are enticing me to admit that, after all, it
          is mine? But indeed, M. Poirot, it isn’t.” She spoke with great
          earnestness.
        </p>
        <p class="p453 ft3">
          “Then why, if the handkerchief was not yours, did you alter the name
          in the passport?” The Count answered this.

    <div id="page_116">
      <div id="id116_1">
        <p class="p77 ft3">
          “Because we heard that a handkerchief had been found with the initial
          H on it. We talked the matter over together before we came to be
          interviewed. I pointed out to Helena that if it were seen that her
          Christian name began with an H she would immediately be subjected to
          much more rigorous questioning. And the thing was so
          <nobr>simple—to</nobr> alter Helena to Elena, was easily done.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You have, M. le Comte, the makings of a very fine criminal,” remarked
          Poirot dryly. “A great natural ingenuity, and an apparently
          remorseless determination to mislead justice.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh, no, no.” The girl leaned forward. “M. Poirot, he’s explained to
          you how it was.” She broke from French into English. “I was
          <nobr>scared—absolutely</nobr> dead scared, you understand. It had
          been so <nobr>awful—that</nobr> <nobr>time—and</nobr> to have it all
          raked up again. And to be suspected and perhaps thrown into prison. I
          was just scared stiff, M. Poirot. Can’t you understand at all?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Her voice was <nobr>lovely—deep—rich—pleading,</nobr> the voice of the
          daughter of Linda Arden the actress.
        </p>
        <p class="p113 ft3">Poirot looked gravely at her.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “If I am to believe you, <nobr>Madame—and</nobr> I do not say that I
          will <span class="ft4">not </span>believe <nobr>you—then</nobr> you
          must help me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Help you?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Yes. The reason for the murder lies in the <nobr>past—in</nobr> that
          tragedy which broke up your home and saddened your young life. Take me
          back into the past, Mademoiselle, that I may find there the link that
          explains the whole thing.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What can there be to tell you? They are all dead.” She repeated
          mournfully: “All <nobr>dead—all</nobr> <nobr>dead—Robert,</nobr>
          <nobr>Sonia—darling,</nobr> darling Daisy. She was so
          <nobr>sweet—so</nobr> <nobr>happy—she</nobr> had such lovely curls. We
          were all just crazy about her.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “There was another victim, Madame. An indirect victim, you might say.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Poor Susanne? Yes, I had forgotten about her. The police questioned
          her. They were convinced that she had something to do with it. Perhaps
          she <nobr>had—but</nobr> if so only innocently. She had, I believe,
          chatted idly with someone, giving information as to the time of
          Daisy’s outings. The poor thing got terribly wrought
          <nobr>up—she</nobr> thought she was being held responsible.” She
          shuddered. “She threw herself out of the window. Oh! it was horrible.”
        </p>
        <p class="p454 ft3">
          She buried her face in her hands. “What nationality was she, Madame?”
          “She was French.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“What was her last name?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “It’s absurd, but I can’t <nobr>remember—we</nobr> all called her
          Susanne. A pretty, laughing girl. She was devoted to Daisy.”
        </p>
        <p class="p455 ft3">
          “She was the <nobr>nursery-maid,</nobr> was she not?” “Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“Who was the nurse?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “She was a trained hospital nurse. Stengelberg her name was. She too
          was devoted to Daisy— and to my sister.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully before you answer this
          question. Have you, since you were on this train, seen anyone that you
          recognised?”
        </p>
        <p class="p163 ft5">
          She stared at him. “I? No, no one at all.” “What about Princess
          Dragomiroff?”
        </p>
        <p class="p105 ft5">
          “Oh! her. I know her, of course. I thought you meant
          <nobr>anyone—anyone</nobr> <nobr>from—from</nobr> that time.” “So I
          did, Madame. Now think carefully. Some years have passed, remember.
          The person
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">might have altered his or her appearance.”</p>

          Helena pondered deeply. Then she said: <nobr>“No—I</nobr> am
          <nobr>sure—there</nobr> is no one.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You <nobr>yourself—you</nobr> were a young girl at the

          to look after you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Oh! yes, I had a <nobr>dragon—a</nobr> sort of governess to me and
          secretary to Sonia combined. She was <nobr>English—or</nobr> rather
          Scotch; a big <nobr>red-haired</nobr> woman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p456 ft3">
          “What was her name?” “Miss Freebody.” “Young or old?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “She seemed frightfully old to me. I suppose she couldn’t have been
          more than forty. Susanne, of course, used to look after my clothes and
          maid me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p457 ft5">

          When the Count and Countess had departed, Poirot looked across at the
          other two. “You see,” he said “we make progress.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Excellent work,” said M. Bouc cordially. “On my part, I should never
          have dreamed of suspecting Count and Countess Andrenyi. I will admit I
          thought them quite <span class="ft22">hors de combat</span>. I suppose
          there is no doubt that she committed the crime? It is rather sad.
          Still, they will not guillotine her. There are extenuating
          circumstances. A few years’ <nobr>imprisonment—that</nobr> will be
          all.”
        </p>
        <p class="p153 ft3">“In fact you are quite certain of her guilt.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “My dear <nobr>friend—surely</nobr> there is no doubt of it? I thought
          your reassuring manner was only to smooth things over till we are dug
          out of the snow and the police take charge.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You do not believe the Count’s positive <nobr>assertion—on</nobr> his
          word of <nobr>honor—that</nobr> his wife is innocent?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Mon </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft4">cher</span>—naturally—what</nobr> else
          <span class="ft4">could </span>he say? He adores his wife. He wants to
          save her! He tells his lie very <nobr>well—quite</nobr> in the grand
          seigneur manner. But what else than a lie could it be?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Well, you know, I had the preposterous idea that it might be the
          truth.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “No, no. The handkerchief, remember. The handkerchief clinches the
          matter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh, I am not so sure about the handkerchief. You remember, I always
          told you that there were two possibilities as to the ownership of the
          handkerchief.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“All the <nobr>same—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          M. Bouc broke off. The door at the end had opened, and Princess
          Dragomiroff entered the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> She came straight to
          them and all three men rose to their feet.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She spoke to Poirot, ignoring the others.</p>
        <p class="p461 ft5">
          “I believe, Monsieur,” she said, “that you have a handkerchief of
          mine.” Poirot shot a glance of triumph at the other two.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Is this it, Madame?”</p>
        <p class="p462 ft3">
          He produced the little square of fine cambric. “That is it. It has my
          initial in the corner.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “But, Madame la Princesse, that is the letter H,” said M. Bouc. “Your
          Christian name— pardon <nobr>me—is</nobr> Natalia.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She gave him a cold stare.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “That is correct, Monsieur. My handkerchiefs are always initialled in
          the Russian characters. H is N in Russian.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          M. Bouc was somewhat taken aback. There was something about this
          indomitable old lady which made him feel flustered and uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p class="p144 ft3">
          “You did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours at the inquiry
          this morning.” “You did not ask me,” said the Princess drily.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Pray be seated, Madame,” said Poirot.</p>
        <p class="p323 ft3">
          She sighed. “I may as well, I suppose.” She sat down. “You need not
          make a long business of this, Messieurs.”

          Your next question will <nobr>be—How</nobr> did my handkerchief come
          to be lying by a murdered man’s body! My reply to that is that I have
          no idea.”
        </p>
        <p class="p463 ft3">“You have really no idea?” “None whatever.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “You will excuse me, Madame, but how much can we rely upon the
          truthfulness of your replies?”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">Poirot said the words very softly.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Princess Dragomiroff answered contemptuously. “I suppose you mean
          because I did not tell you that Helena Andrenyi was Mrs. Armstrong’s
          sister?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “In fact you deliberately lied to us in the matter.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Certainly. I would do the same again. Her mother was my friend. I
          believe, Messieurs, in <nobr>loyalty—to</nobr> one’s friends and one’s
          family and one’s caste.”
        </p>
        <p class="p464 ft5">
          “You do not believe in doing your utmost to further the ends of
          justice?” “In this case I consider that <nobr>justice—strict</nobr>
          <nobr>justice—has</nobr> been done.” Poirot leaned forward.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You see my difficulty, Madame. In this matter of the handkerchief,
          even, am I to believe you? Or are you shielding your friend’s
          daughter?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Oh! I see what you mean.” Her face broke into a grim smile. “Well,
          Messieurs, this statement of mine can be easily proved. I will give
          you the address of the people in Paris who make my handkerchiefs. You
          have only to show them the one in question and they will inform you
          that it was made to my order over a year ago. The handkerchief is
          mine, Messieurs.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">She rose.</p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">“Have you anything further you wish to ask me?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this handkerchief when we showed
          it to her this morning?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “She must have done so. She saw it and said nothing? Ah, well, that
          shows that she too can be loyal.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          With a slight inclination of her head she passed out of the
          <nobr>dining-car.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “So that was it,” murmured Poirot softly. “I noticed just a trifling
          hesitation when I asked the maid if she knew to whom the handkerchief
          belonged. She was uncertain whether or not to admit that it was her
          mistress’s. But how does that fit in with that strange central idea of
          mine? Yes, it might well be.”
        </p>
        <p class="p465 ft23">
          “Ah!” said M. Bouc with a characteristic gesture. “She is a terrible
          old lady, that!” “Could she have murdered Ratchett?” asked Poirot of
          the doctor.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">He shook his head.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Those <nobr>blows—the</nobr> ones delivered with great force
          penetrating the <nobr>muscle—never,</nobr> never could anyone with so
          frail a physique inflict them.”
        </p>
        <p class="p466 ft3">“But the feebler ones?” “The feebler ones, yes.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I am thinking,” said Poirot, “of the incident this morning when I
          said to her that the strength was in her will rather than in her arm.
          It was in the nature of a trap, that remark. I wanted to see if she
          would look down at her right or her left arm. She did neither. She
          looked at them both. But she made a strange reply. She said, ‘No, I
          have no strength in these. I do not know whether to be sorry or glad.’
          A curious remark that. It confirms me in my belief about the crime.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It did not settle the point about the <nobr>left-handedness.”</nobr>

          “No. By the way, did you notice that Count Andrenyi keeps his
          handkerchief in his <nobr>right-hand</nobr> breast pocket?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          M. Bouc shook his head. His mind reverted to the astonishing
          revelations of the last <nobr>half-hour.</nobr> He murmured:
        </p>
        <p class="p467 ft5">
          <nobr>“Lies—and</nobr> again lies. It amazes me, the number of lies we
          had told to us this morning.” “There are more still to discover,” said
          Poirot cheerfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You think so?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I shall be very much disappointed if it is not so.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Such duplicity is terrible,” said M. Bouc. “But it seems to please
          you,” he added reproachfully.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “It has this advantage,” said Poirot. “If you confront anyone who has
          lied with the truth, he will usually admit <nobr>it—often</nobr> out
          of sheer surprise. It is only necessary to guess
          <span class="ft22">right </span>to produce your effect.
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft5">
          “That is the only way to conduct this case. I select each passenger in
          turn, consider his or her evidence, and say to myself, ‘<span
            class="ft4"
            >If </span
          >so and so is lying, on what <span class="ft4">point </span>is he
          lying, and what is the <span class="ft4">reason </span>for the lie?’
          And I answer, ‘If he is <nobr>lying—if,</nobr> you
          <nobr>mark—it</nobr> could only be for such a reason and on such a
          point.’ We have done that once very successfully with Countess
          Andrenyi. We shall now proceed to try the same method on several other
          persons.”
        </p>
        <p class="p468 ft3">
          “And supposing, my friend, that your guess happens to be wrong?” “Then
          one person, at any rate, will be completely freed from suspicion.”
          <nobr>“Ah!—a</nobr> process of elimination.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Exactly.”</p>

          Colonel Arbuthnot was clearly annoyed at being summoned to the
          <nobr>dining-car</nobr> for a second interview. His face wore a most
          forbidding expression as he sat down and said:
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Well?”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “All my apologies for troubling you a second time,” said Poirot. “But
          there is still some information that I think you might be able to give
          us.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Indeed? I hardly think so.”</p>
        <p class="p470 ft5">
          “To begin with, you see this <nobr>pipe-cleaner?”</nobr> “Yes.”

        <p class="p5 ft3">“Is it one of yours?”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Don’t know. I don’t put a private mark on them, you know.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “Are you aware, Colonel Arbuthnot, that you are the only man amongst
          the passengers in the <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> carriage who smokes
          a pipe?”
        </p>
        <p class="p163 ft5">
          “In that case it probably is one of mine.” “Do you know where it was
          found?” “Not the least idea.”
        </p>
        <p class="p357 ft3">
          “It was found by the body of the murdered man.” Colonel Arbuthnot
          raised his eyebrows.
        </p>
        <p class="p379 ft5">
          “Can you tell us, Colonel Arbuthnot, how it is likely to have got
          there?” “If you mean, did I drop it there myself, no, I didn’t.”
        </p>
        <p class="p376 ft3">
          “Did you go into Mr. Ratchett’s compartment at any time?” “I never

        <p class="p75 ft5">
          “You never spoke to him and you did not murder him?” The colonel’s
          eyebrows went up again sardonically.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “If I had, I should hardly be likely to acquaint you with the fact. As
          a matter of fact I <span class="ft22">didn’t </span>murder the
          fellow.”
        </p>
        <p class="p471 ft5">
          “Ah, well,” murmured Poirot. “It is of no consequence.” “I beg your
          pardon?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I said that it was of no consequence.”</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Oh!” Arbuthnot looked taken aback. He eyed Poirot uneasily.

          “Because, you see,” continued the little man, “the

          of eleven other excellent explanations of its presence.”

        <p class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot stared at him.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “What I really wished to see you about was quite another matter,” went
          on Poirot. “Miss Debenham may have told you, perhaps, that I overheard
          some words spoken to you at the station of Konya?”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">Arbuthnot did not reply.</p>

        <p class="p409 ft3">
          “I am sorry, M. Poirot, but I must refuse to answer that question.”

          The Colonel said stiffly, “I suggest that you ask Miss Debenham
          herself for the meaning of those words.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“I have done so.”</p>
        <p class="p472 ft5">“And she refused to tell you?” “Yes.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Then I should think it would have been perfectly
          <nobr>plain—even</nobr> to <nobr>you—that</nobr> my lips are sealed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p473 ft3">
          “You will not give away a lady’s secret?” “You can put it that way, if
          you like.”
        </p>
        <p class="p474 ft3">
          “Miss Debenham told me that they referred to a private matter of her
          own.” “Then why not accept her word for it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Because, Colonel Arbuthnot, Miss Debenham is what one might call a
          highly suspicious character.”
        </p>
        <p class="p475 ft3">
          “Nonsense,” said the Colonel with warmth. “It is not nonsense.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“You have nothing whatever against her.”</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Not the fact that Miss Debenham was companion governess; in the
          Armstrong household at the time of the kidnapping of little Daisy
          Armstrong?”
        </p>
        <p class="p476 ft5">
          There was a minute’s dead silence. Poirot nodded his head gently.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “You see,” he said. “We know more than you think. If Miss Debenham is
          innocent, why did she conceal that fact? Why did she tell me that she
          had never been in America?”
        </p>
        <p class="p73 ft3">
          The Colonel cleared his throat. “Aren’t you possibly making a
          mistake?” “I am making no mistake. Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          Colonel Arbuthnot shrugged his shoulders. “You had better ask her. I
          still think that you are wrong.”
        </p>
        <p class="p146 ft3">
          Poirot raised his voice and called. One of the restaurant attendants
          came from the far end of the car.
        </p>
        <p class="p477 ft3">
          “Go and ask the English lady in No. 11 if she will be good enough to
          come here.” “<span class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</span>.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          The man departed. The four men sat in silence. Colonel Arbuthnot’s
          face looked as though it were carved out of wood, rigid and impassive.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">The man returned.</p>
        <p class="p478 ft5">
          “The lady is just coming, Monsieur.” “Thank you.”

        <p class="p118 ft3">
          She wore no hat. Her head was thrown back as though in defiance. “The
          sweep of her hair back from her face, the curve of her nostril
          suggested the <nobr>figure-head</nobr> of a ship plunging gallantly
          into a rough sea. In that moment she was beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Her eyes went to Arbuthnot for a <nobr>minute—just</nobr> a minute.
          She said to Poirot, “You wished to see me?”
        </p>
        <p class="p242 ft5">
          “I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you lied to us this morning?”
          “Lied to you? I don’t know what you mean.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You concealed the fact that at the time of the Armstrong tragedy you
          were actually living in the house. You told me that you had never been
          in America.”
        </p>
        <p class="p370 ft3">
          He saw her flinch for a moment and then recover herself. “Yes,” she
          said. “That is true.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“No, Mademoiselle, it was false.”</p>
        <p class="p443 ft5">
          “You misunderstood me. I mean that it is true that I lied to you.”
          “Ah, you admit it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p242 ft5">
          Her lips curved into a smile. “Certainly, since you have found me
          out.” “You are at least frank, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“There does not seem anything else for me to be.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Well, of course, that is true. And now, Mademoiselle, may I ask you
          the reason for these evasions?”
        </p>
        <p class="p480 ft3">
          “I should have thought the reason leapt to the eye, M. Poirot.” “It
          does not leap to mine, Mademoiselle.”
        </p>
        <p class="p164 ft5">
          She said in a quiet even voice with a trace of hardness in it, “I have
          my living to get.” “You <nobr>mean—?”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She raised her eyes and looked him full in the face. “How much do you
          know, M. Poirot, of the fight to get and keep decent employment? Do
          you think that a girl who had been detained in connection with a
          murder case, whose name and perhaps photograph were reproduced in the
          English <nobr>papers—do</nobr> you think that any nice ordinary
          <nobr>middle-class</nobr> woman would want to engage that girl as
          governess to her daughters?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “I do not see why <nobr>not—if</nobr> no blame attached to you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Oh, <nobr>blame—it</nobr> is not
          <nobr><span class="ft22">blame</span>—it</nobr> is the publicity! So
          far, M. Poirot, I have succeeded in life. I have had
          <nobr>well-paid,</nobr> pleasant posts. I was not going to risk the
          position I had attained when no good end could have been served.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I will venture to suggest, Mademoiselle, that I would have been the
          best judge of that, not you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
        <p class="p464 ft3">
          “For instance, you could have helped me in the matter of
          identification.” “What do you mean?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “Is it possible, Mademoiselle, that you did not recognise in the
          Countess Andrenyi, Mrs. Armstrong’s young sister whom you taught in
          New York?”
        </p>

    <div id="page_124">
      <div id="id124_1">
        <p class="p99 ft5">
          “Countess Andrenyi? No.” She shook her head. “It may seem
          extraordinary to <nobr>you—but</nobr> I did not recognise her. She was
          not grown up, you see, when I knew her. That was over three years ago.
          It is true that the Countess reminded me of someone; it puzzled me.
          But she looks so <nobr>foreign—I</nobr> never connected her with the
          little American schoolgirl. I only glanced at her casually when coming
          into the restaurant car, and I noticed her clothes more than her
          face.” She smiled faintly. “Women do! And <nobr>then—well—I</nobr> had
          my own preoccupations.”
        </p>
        <p class="p481 ft3">
          “You will not tell me your secret, Mademoiselle?” Poirot’s voice was
          very gentle and persuasive. She said in a low voice, “I
          <nobr>can’t—I</nobr> can’t.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          And suddenly, without warning, she broke down, dropping her face down
          upon her outstretched arms and crying as though her heart would break.
        </p>
        <p class="p471 ft5">
          The Colonel sprang up and stood awkwardly beside her.
          <nobr>“I—look</nobr> <nobr>here—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          He stopped and turning round scowled fiercely at Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p482 ft5">
          “I’ll break every bone in your damned body, you dirty little
          <nobr>whipper-snapper,”</nobr> he said. “Monsieur,” protested M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Arbuthnot had turned back to the girl. <nobr>“Mary—for</nobr> God’s
          <nobr>sake—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          She sprang up. “It’s nothing. I’m all right. You don’t need me any
          more, do you, M. Poirot? If you do, you must come and find me. Oh,
          what an <nobr>idiot—what</nobr> an idiot I’m making of myself!” She
          hurried out of the car.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Arbuthnot, before following her, turned once more on Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Miss Debenham’s got nothing to do with this
          <nobr>business—nothing,</nobr> do you hear? And if she’s worried and
          interfered with, you’ll have me to deal with.” He strode out.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I like to see an angry Englishman,” said Poirot. “They are very
          amusing. The more emotional they feel, the less command they have of
          language.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          But M. Bouc was not interested in the emotional reactions of
          Englishmen. He was overcome by admiration of his friend.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mon cher, vous êtes épatant</span>!” he cried.
          “Another miraculous guess.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “It is incredible how you think of these things,” said Dr. Constantine
          admiringly.
        </p>
        <p class="p483 ft5">
          “Oh, I claim no credit this time. It was not a guess. Countess
          Andrenyi practically told me.” “<span class="ft4">Comment</span>?
          Surely not?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “You remember, I asked her about her governess or companion? I had
          already decided in my mind that <span class="ft4">if </span>Mary
          Debenham were mixed up in the matter, she must have figured in the
          household in some such capacity.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “Yes, but the Countess Andrenyi described a totally different person.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Exactly. A tall <nobr>middle-aged</nobr> woman with red
          <nobr>hair—in</nobr> fact, the exact opposite in every respect of Miss
          Debenham, so much so as to be quite remarkable. But then she had to
          invent a name quickly, and there it was that the unconscious
          association of ideas gave her away. She said, Miss Freebody, you
          remember.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Yes?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Eh bien</span>, you may not know it, but there is
          a shop in London that was called until recently Debenham & Freebody.
          With the name Debenham running in her head, the Countess clutches at
          another name quickly, and the first that comes is Freebody. Naturally
          I understood immediately.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“That is yet another lie. Why did she do it?’</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Possibly more loyalty. It makes things a little difficult.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Ma foi</span>!” said M. Bouc with violence. “But

          “It is really a <span class="ft4">most </span>extraordinary case,”

          Poirot had by this time requested the

        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          The big Italian had a wary look in his eye as he came in. He shot
          nervous glances from side to side like a trapped animal.
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “What do you want!” he said. “I have nothing more to tell

          truth!”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “The truth?” He shot an uneasy glance at Poirot. All the assurance and

        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">Mais oui</span>. It may be that I know it already.

          spontaneously.”

          “You talk like the American police. ‘Come <nobr>clean’—that</nobr> is

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot was writing something on a sheet of paper. He looked up and
          said quietly: “Very good. You can go.”

        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Foscarelli lingered uneasily. “You realise that it was not I? That I

        <p class="p5 ft3">“I said that you could go.”</p>

        <p class="p5 ft3">

          “What is that you are saying? Why, that little

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          His voice had softened. The tears came into his eyes. Then he wheeled
          round abruptly on his heel and strode out of the

          The <nobr>dining-car</nobr> attendant came at a run. “The No.

        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“My head is spinning,” groaned M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p122 ft3">
          Greta Ohlsson was ushered in sympathetically by the attendant. She was
          weeping bitterly. She collapsed on the seat facing Poirot and wept
          steadily into a large handkerchief.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Now do not distress yourself, Mademoiselle. Do not distress
          yourself,” Poirot patted her on the shoulder. “Just a few little words
          of truth, that is all. You were the nurse who was in charge of little
          Daisy Armstrong?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “It is <nobr>true—it</nobr> is true,” wept the wretched woman. “Ah,
          she was an <nobr>angel—a</nobr> little sweet trustful angel. She knew
          nothing but kindness and <nobr>love—and</nobr> she was taken away by
          that wicked <nobr>man—cruelly</nobr> <nobr>treated—and</nobr> her poor
          <nobr>mother—and</nobr> the other little one who never lived at all.
          You cannot <nobr>understand—you</nobr> cannot <nobr>know—if</nobr> you
          had been there as I <nobr>was—if</nobr> you had seen the whole
          terrible tragedy! I ought to have told you the truth about myself this
          morning. But I was <nobr>afraid—afraid.</nobr> I did so rejoice that
          that evil man was <nobr>dead—that</nobr> he could not any more kill or
          torture little children. Ah! I cannot <nobr>speak—I</nobr> have no
          words. ...”
        </p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">She wept with more vehemence than ever.</p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          Poirot continued to pat her gently on the shoulder.

          <nobr>everything—everything,</nobr> I tell you. I will ask you no more
          questions. It is enough that you have admitted what I know to be the
          truth. I understand, I tell you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          By now inarticulate with sobs, Greta Ohlsson rose and groped her way
          towards the door. As she reached it she collided with a man coming in.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">It was the <nobr>valet—Masterman.</nobr></p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          He came straight up to Poirot and spoke in his usual quiet,
          unemotional voice’.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I hope I’m not intruding, sir. I thought it best to come along at
          once, sir, and tell you the truth. I was Colonel Armstrong’s batman in
          the War, sir, and afterwards I was his valet in New York. I’m afraid I
          concealed that fact this morning. It was very wrong of me, sir, and I
          thought I’d better come and make a clean breast of it. But I hope,
          sir, that you’re not suspecting Tonio in any way. Old Tonio, sir,
          wouldn’t hurt a fly. And I can swear positively that he never left the
          carriage all last night. So, you see, sir, he couldn’t have done it.
          Tonio may be a foreigner, sir, but he’s a very gentle creature. Not
          like those nasty murdering Italians one reads about.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He stopped.</p>
        <p class="p154 ft3">
          Poirot looked steadily at him. “Is that all you have to say?”

        <p class="p65 ft3">“That is all, sir.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          He paused; then, as Poirot did not speak, he made an apologetic little
          bow and after a momentary hesitation left the
          <nobr>dining-car</nobr> in the same quiet unobtrusive fashion as he
          had come.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “This,” said Dr. Constantine, “is more wildly improbable than any
          <span class="ft22">roman policier </span>I have ever read.”
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “I agree,” said M. Bouc. “Of the twelve passengers in that coach, nine
          have been proved to have had a connection with the Armstrong case.
          What next, I ask you? Or should I say, who next?”
        </p>
        <p class="p70 ft3">
          “I can almost give you the answer to your question,” said Poirot.
          “Here comes our American sleuth, Mr. Hardman.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Is he, too, coming to confess?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Before Poirot could reply the American had reached their table. He
          cocked an alert eye at them and sitting down he drawled out: “Just
          exactly what’s up on this train? It seems bughouse to me.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">Poirot twinkled at him.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Are you quite sure, Mr. Hardman, that you yourself were not the
          gardener at the Armstrong home?”
        </p>
        <p class="p490 ft3">
          “They didn’t have a garden,” replied Mr. Hardman literally. “Or the
          butler?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Haven’t got the fancy manners for a place like that. No, I never had
          any connection with the Armstrong <nobr>house—but</nobr> I’m beginning
          to believe I’m about the only one on this train who hadn’t! Can you
          beat it? That’s what I <nobr>say—can</nobr> you beat it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p300 ft3">
          “It is certainly a little surprising,” said Poirot mildly. “<span
            class="ft22"
            >C’est rigolo</span
          >,” burst from M. Bouc.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “Have you any ideas of your own about the crime, Mr. Hardman?”
          inquired Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, sir. It’s got me beat. I don’t know how to figure it out. They
          can’t <span class="ft22">all </span>be in <nobr>it—but</nobr> which
          one is the guilty party is beyond me. How did you get wise to all
          this? That’s what I want to know.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">“I just guessed.”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Then, believe me, you’re a pretty slick guesser. Yes, I’ll tell the
          world you’re a slick guesser.”
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">
          Mr. Hardman leaned back and looked at Poirot admiringly.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You’ll excuse me,” he said, “but no one would believe it to look at
          you. I take off my hat to you. I do indeed.”
        </p>
        <p class="p491 ft3">
          “You are too kind, M. Hardman.” “Not at all. I’ve got to hand it to
          you.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          “All the same,” said Poirot, “the problem is not yet quite solved. Can
          we say with authority that we know who killed M. Ratchett?”
        </p>
        <p class="p81 ft5">
          “Count me out,” said Mr. Hardman. “I’m not saying anything at all. I’m
          just full of natural admiration. What about the other two you haven’t
          had a guess at yet? The old American dame, and the
          <nobr>lady’s-maid?</nobr> I suppose we can take it that they’re the
          only innocent parties on the train?” “Unless,” said Poirot, smiling,
          “we can fit them into our little collection <nobr>as—shall</nobr> we
          say—
        </p>
        <p class="p6 ft3">housekeeper and cook in the Armstrong household?”</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well, nothing in the world would surprise me now,” said Mr. Hardman
          with quiet resignation. <nobr>“Bughouse—that’s</nobr> what this
          business <nobr>is—bughouse!”</nobr>

          “Ah! <span class="ft24">mon cher</span>, that would be indeed
          stretching coincidence a little too far,” said M. Bouc. “They cannot
          all be in it.”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Poirot looked at him. “You do not understand,” he said. “You do not
          understand at all. Tell me, do you know who killed Ratchett?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“Do you?” countered M. Bouc.</p>
        <p class="p80 ft5">
          Poirot nodded. “Oh, yes,” he said. “I have known for some time. It is
          so clear that I wonder you have not seen it also.” He looked at
          Hardman and asked: “And you?”
        </p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          The detective shook his head. He stared at Poirot curiously. “I don’t
          know,” he said. “I don’t know at all. Which of them was it?”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">Poirot was silent a minute. Then he said:</p>
        <p class="p80 ft3">
          “If you will be so good, M. Hardman, assemble everyone here. There are
          two possible solutions of this case. I want to lay them both before

          The passengers came crowding into the restaurant car and took their
          seats round the tables. They all bore more or less the same
          expression, one of expectancy mingled with apprehension. The Swedish
          lady was still weeping, and Mrs. Hubbard was comforting her.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Now you must just take a hold on yourself, my dear. Everything’s
          going to be perfectly all right. You mustn’t lose your grip on
          yourself. If one of us is a nasty murderer, we know quite well it

          You sit here, and I’ll stay right by <nobr>you—and</nobr> don’t you

        <p class="p493 ft3">
          The Wagon Lit conductor was hovering in the doorway. “You permit that
          I stay, Monsieur?” “Certainly, Michel.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot cleared his throat.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “<span class="ft4">Messieurs et mesdames</span>, I will speak in
          English since I think all of you know a little of that language. We
          are here to investigate the death of Samuel Edward

        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Now you all know the facts of the case. Mr. Ratchett was found
          stabbed this morning. He was last known to be alive at 12.37 last
          night when he spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor through the door. A
          watch in his pyjama pocket was found to be badly dented, and it had
          stopped at a quarter past one. Dr. Constantine, who examined the body
          when found, puts the time of death as having been between midnight and
          two in the morning. At half an hour after midnight, as you all know,
          the train ran into a snowdrift. After that time
          <span class="ft22"

          compartment (No. 16 at the extreme end) without being seen by him. We
          are therefore forced to the conclusion that the murderer is to be
          found among the occupants of one particular coach— the
          <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> coach.
        </p>
        <p class="p108 ft3">

        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “But I will put before you an alternative theory. It is very simple.
          Mr. Ratchett had a certain enemy whom he feared. He gave Mr. Hardman a
          description of this enemy and told him that the attempt, if made at
          all, would most probably be made on the second night out from
          Stamboul.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Now I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr. Ratchett knew a
          good deal more than he told. The enemy, as Mr. Ratchett expected,
          joined the train
          <span class="ft22">at Belgrade or else at Vincovci </span>by the door
          left open by Colonel Arbuthnot and Mr. MacQueen, who had just
          descended to the platform. He was provided with a suit of Wagon Lit
          uniform, which he wore over his ordinary clothes, and a
          <nobr>pass-key</nobr> which enabled him to gain access to Mr.
          Ratchett’s compartment in spite of the door’s being locked. Mr.
          Ratchett was under the influence of a sleeping draught. This man
          stabbed him with great ferocity and left the compartment through the
          communicating door leading to Mrs. Hubbard’s
          <nobr>compartment—”</nobr>

          <nobr>sponge-bag</nobr> in passing. Without knowing it, he lost a
          button of his uniform. Then he slipped out of the compartment and
          along the corridor. He hastily thrust the uniform into a suitcase in
          an empty compartment, and a few minutes later, dressed in ordinary
          clothes, he left the train just before it started off, using the same
          means for <nobr>egress—the</nobr> door near the
          <nobr>dining-car.”</nobr>

          ahead of Central European time. It was a quarter past twelve when Mr.

          voice that spoke from the compartment at
          <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one? It was either the voice of
          <nobr>Ratchett—or</nobr> else that of his murderer.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Not necessarily. It might have <nobr>been—well—a</nobr> third person.
          One who had gone in to speak to Ratchett and found him dead. He rang
          the bell to summon the conductor; then, as you express it, the wind
          rose in <nobr>him—he</nobr> was afraid of being accused of the crime,
          and he spoke pretending to be Ratchett.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          “<span class="ft22">C’est possible</span>,” admitted M. Bouc
          grudgingly.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Poirot looked at Mrs. Hubbard. “Yes, Madame, you were going to
          <nobr>say—”</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well, I don’t quite know what I was going to say. Do you think I
          forgot to put my watch back too?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “No, Madame. I think you heard the man pass
          <nobr>through—but</nobr> unconsciously. Later you had a nightmare of a
          man being in your compartment and woke up with a start and rang for
          the conductor.”
        </p>
        <p class="p72 ft3">
          “Well, I suppose that’s possible,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Princess Dragomiroff was looking at Poirot with a very direct glance.
          “How do you explain the evidence of my maid, Monsieur?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Very simply, Madame. Your maid recognised the handkerchief I showed
          her as yours. She somewhat clumsily tried to shield you. She did
          encounter the man, but <nobr>earlier—while</nobr> the train was at
          Vincovci station. She pretended to have seen him at a later hour, with
          a confused idea of giving you a <nobr>water-tight</nobr> alibi.”
        </p>
        <p class="p411 ft3">
          The Princess bowed her head. “You have thought of everything,
          Monsieur. <nobr>I—I</nobr> admire you.” There was a silence.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          Then everyone jumped as Dr. Constantine suddenly hit the table a blow
          with his fist.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “But no,” he said. “No, no, and again no! That is an explanation that
          will not hold water. It is deficient in a dozen minor points. The
          crime was not committed <nobr>so—M.</nobr> Poirot must know that
          perfectly well.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          Poirot turned a curious glance on him. “I see,” he said, “that I shall
          have to give you my second solution. But do not abandon this one too
          abruptly. You may agree with it later.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He turned back again to face the others.</p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">
          “There is another possible solution of the crime. This is how I
          arrived at it.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “When I had heard all the evidence, I leaned back and shut my eyes,
          and began to <span class="ft22">think</span>. Certain points presented
          themselves to me as worthy of attention. I enumerated these points to
          my two colleagues. Some I have already <nobr>elucidated—such</nobr> as
          a grease spot on a passport, and so on. I will run over the points
          that remain. The first and most important is a remark made to me by

          M. Bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leaving
          <nobr>Stamboul—to</nobr> the effect that the company assembled was
          interesting because it was so <nobr>varied—representing</nobr> as it
          did all classes and nationalities.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I agreed with him, but when this particular point came into my mind,
          I tried to imagine whether such an assembly was ever likely to be
          collected under any other conditions. And the answer I made to myself
          <nobr>was—only</nobr> in America. In America there might be a
          household composed of just such varied
          <nobr>nationalities—an</nobr> Italian chauffeur, an English governess,
          a Swedish nurse, a German <nobr>lady’s-maid,</nobr> and so on. That
          led me to my scheme of <nobr>‘guessing’—that</nobr> is, casting each
          person for a certain part in the Armstrong drama much as a producer
          casts a play. Well, that gave me an extremely interesting and
          satisfactory result.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I had also examined in my own mind each separate person’s evidence,
          with some curious results. Take first the evidence of Mr. MacQueen. My
          first interview with him was entirely satisfactory. But in my second
          he made rather a curious remark. I had described to him the finding of
          a note mentioning the Armstrong case. He said, ‘But
          <nobr>surely—’</nobr> and then paused and went on, ‘I
          <nobr>mean—that</nobr> was rather careless of the old man.’
        </p>
        <p class="p100 ft3">
          “Now I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say.
          <span class="ft22"
            >Supposing what he had meant to say was ‘But surely that was burnt!’ </span
          >In which case,
          <span class="ft22">MacQueen knew of the note and of its </span
          ><nobr><span class="ft22">destruction</span>—in</nobr> other words, he
          was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer. Very good.
        </p>
        <p class="p71 ft3">
          “Then the valet. He said his master was in the habit of taking a
          sleeping draught when travelling by train. That might be true,
          <span class="ft22">but would Ratchett have taken one last night</span
          >? The automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement.
          Ratchett intended to be on the alert last night. Whatever narcotic was
          administered to him must have been given without his knowledge. By
          whom? Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Now we come to the evidence of Mr. Hardman. I believed all that he
          told me about his own identity, but when it came to the actual methods
          he had employed to guard Mr. Ratchett, his story was neither more nor
          less than absurd. The only way to have protected Ratchett effectively
          was to pass the night actually in his compartment or in some spot
          where he could watch the door. The one thing that his evidence
          <span class="ft22">did </span>show plainly was that
          <span class="ft22"
            >no one in any other part of the train could possibly have murdered
            Ratchett</span
          >. It drew a clear circle round the
          <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> carriage. That seemed to me a rather
          curious and inexplicable fact, and I put it aside to think over.
        </p>
        <p class="p494 ft5">
          “You probably all know by now of the few words I overheard between
          Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The interesting thing to my mind
          was the fact that Colonel Arbuthnot called her
          <span class="ft4">Mary </span>and was clearly on terms of intimacy
          with her. But the Colonel was supposed to have met her only a few days
          previously. And I know Englishmen of the Colonel’s
          <nobr>type—even</nobr> if he had fallen in love with the young lady at
          first sight, he would have advanced slowly and with decorum, not
          rushing things. Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss
          Debenham were in reality well acquainted and were for some reason
          pretending to be strangers. Another small point was Miss Debenham’s
          easy familiarity with the term ‘long distance’ for a telephone call.
          Yet Miss Debenham had told me that she had never been in the States.
        </p>
        <p class="p495 ft3">
          “To pass to another witness. Mrs. Hubbard had told us that lying in
          bed she had been unable to see whether the communicating door was
          bolted or not, and so had asked Miss Ohlsson to see for her.
          <nobr>Now—though</nobr> her statement would have been perfectly true
          if she had been occupying compartment No. 2, 4, 12 or any
          <span class="ft22">even </span>number, in which the bolt is directly
          under the handle of the <nobr>door—in</nobr> the
          <span class="ft22">uneven </span>numbers such as compartment No. 3 the

          and could not therefore be masked by the <nobr>sponge-bag</nobr> in
          the least. I was forced to the conclusion that Mrs. Hubbard was
          inventing an incident that had never occurred.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “And here let me say just a word or two about
          <span class="ft22">times</span>. To my mind the really interesting
          point about the dented watch, is the place where it was
          <nobr>found—in</nobr> Ratchett’s pyjama pocket, a singularly
          uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep one’s watch, especially as
          there is a watch ‘hook’ provided just by the head of the bed. I felt
          sure, therefore, that the watch had been deliberately placed in the
          <nobr>pocket—faked.</nobr> The crime, then, was not committed at a
          quarter past one.
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft5">
          “Was it then committed earlier? To be exact, at
          <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one? My friend M. Bouc advanced
          as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep.
          But if Ratchett had been heavily drugged,
          <span class="ft4">he could not have cried out</span>. If he had been
          capable of crying out, he would have been capable of making some kind
          of struggle to defend himself, and there were no signs of any such
          struggle.
        </p>
        <p class="p198 ft3">
          “I remembered that MacQueen had called attention, not once but twice
          (and the second time in a very blatant manner), to the fact that
          Ratchett could speak no French. I came to the conclusion that the
          whole business at <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one was a
          comedy played for my benefit! Anyone might see through the watch
          <nobr>business—it</nobr> is a common enough device in detective
          stories. They assumed that I <span class="ft22">should </span>see
          through it and that, pluming myself on my own cleverness, I would go
          on to assume that since Ratchett spoke no French, the voice I heard at
          <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one could not have been his, and
          that Ratchett must have been already dead. But I am convinced that at
          <nobr>twenty-three</nobr> minutes to one Ratchett was still lying in
          his drugged sleep.
        </p>
        <p class="p135 ft3">
          “But the device has succeeded! I have opened my door and looked out. I
          have actually heard the French phrase used. If I am so unbelievably
          dense as not to realise the significance of that phrase, it must be
          brought to my attention. If necessary, MacQueen can come right out in
          the open. He can say, ‘Excuse me, M. Poirot,
          <span class="ft22">that can’t have been Mr. Ratchett speaking</span>.
          He couldn’t speak French.’
        </p>
        <p class="p110 ft3">
          “Now, what was the real time of the crime? And who killed him?
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “In my <nobr>opinion—and</nobr> this is only an
          <nobr>opinion—Ratchett</nobr> was killed at some time very close upon
          two o’clock, the latest hour the doctor gives us as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">“As to who killed <nobr>him—”</nobr></p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          He paused, looking at his audience. He could not complain of any lack
          of attention. Every eye was fixed upon him. In the stillness you could
          have heard a pin drop.
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He went on slowly:</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving
          a case against any one person on the train, and by the rather curious
          coincidence that in each case the testimony giving an alibi came from
          what I might describe as an ‘unlikely’ person. Thus, Mr. MacQueen and
          Colonel Arbuthnot provided alibis for each
          <nobr>other—two</nobr> persons between whom it seemed most unlikely
          there should have been any prior acquaintanceship. The same thing
          happened with the English valet and the Italian, and with the Swedish
          lady and the English girl. I said to myself: This is
          <nobr>extraordinary—they</nobr> cannot
          <span class="ft22">all </span>be in it!
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft3">
          “And then, Messieurs, I saw light. They
          <span class="ft22">were </span>all in it. For so many people connected
          with the Armstrong case to be travelling by the same train through
          coincidence was not only unlikely: it was
          <span class="ft22">impossible</span>. It must be not chance, but
          <span class="ft22">design</span>. I remembered a remark of Colonel
          Arbuthnot’s about trial by jury. A jury is composed of twelve
          <nobr>people—there</nobr> were twelve
          <nobr>passengers—Ratchett</nobr> was stabbed twelve times. And the
          thing that had worried me all along—

          the extraordinary crowd travelling in the
          <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> coach at a slack time of
          <nobr>year—this</nobr> was explained.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Ratchett had escaped justice in America. There was no question as to
          his guilt. I visualised a <nobr>self-appointed</nobr> jury of twelve
          people who had condemned him to death and who by the exigencies of the
          case had themselves been forced to be his executioners. And
          immediately, on that assumption, the whole case fell into beautiful
          shining order.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I saw it as a perfect mosaic, each person playing his or her allotted
          part. It was so arranged that, if suspicion should fall on any one
          person, the evidence of one or more of the others would clear the
          accused person and confuse the issue. Hardman’s evidence was necessary
          in case some outsider should be suspected of the crime and be unable
          to prove an alibi. The passengers in the Stamboul carriage were in no
          danger. Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out
          beforehand. The whole thing was a very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle,
          so arranged that every fresh piece of knowledge that came to light
          made the solution of the whole more difficult. As my friend M. Bouc
          remarked, the case seemed fantastically impossible! That was exactly
          the impression intended to be conveyed.
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “Did this solution explain everything? Yes, it did. The nature of the
          <nobr>wounds—each</nobr> inflicted by a different person. The
          artificial threatening <nobr>letters—artificial</nobr> since they were
          unreal, written only to be produced as evidence. (Doubtless there
          <span class="ft22">were </span>real letters, warning Ratchett of his
          fate, which MacQueen destroyed, substituting for them these others.)
          Then Hardman’s story of being called in by
          <nobr>Ratchett—a</nobr> lie, of course, from beginning to end. The
          description of the mythical ‘small dark man with a womanish
          <nobr>voice’—a</nobr> convenient description since it had the merit of
          not incriminating any of the actual Wagon Lit conductors and would
          apply equally well to a man or a woman.
        </p>
        <p class="p124 ft5">
          “The idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one, but on
          reflection nothing else would fit the circumstances so well. A dagger
          was a weapon that could be used by <nobr>everyone—strong</nobr> or
          <nobr>weak—and</nobr> it made no noise. I fancy, though I may be
          wrong, that each person in turn entered Ratchett’s darkened
          compartment through that of Mrs. <nobr>Hubbard—and</nobr> struck! They
          themselves would never know which blow actually killed him.
        </p>
        <p class="p198 ft5">
          “The final letter which Ratchett had probably found on his pillow was
          carefully burnt. With no clue pointing to the Armstrong case there
          would be absolutely no reason for suspecting any of the passengers on
          the train. It would be put down as an outside job, and the ‘small dark
          man with the womanish voice’ would actually have been seen by one or
          more of the passengers leaving the train, at Brod!
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “I do not know exactly what happened when the conspirators discovered
          that this part of their plan was impossible owing to the accident to
          the train. There was, I imagine, a hasty consultation, and then they
          decided to go through with it. It was true that now one and all of the
          passengers were bound to come under suspicion, but that possibility
          had already been foreseen and provided for. The only additional thing
          to be done was to confuse the issue even further. Two
          <nobr>so-called</nobr> ‘clues’ were dropped in the dead man’s
          <nobr>compartment—one</nobr> incriminating Colonel Arbuthnot (who had
          the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was
          probably the hardest to prove); and the second clue, the handkerchief,
          incriminating Princess Dragomiroff who, by virtue of her social
          position, her particularly frail physique and the alibi given her by
          her maid and the conductor, was practically in an unassailable
          position.
        </p>
        <p class="p495 ft3">
          “Further to confuse the issue, a red herring was drawn across the
          <nobr>trail—the</nobr> mythical woman in the red kimono. Again I am to
          bear witness to this woman’s existence. There is a heavy bang at my
          door. I get up and look <nobr>out—and</nobr> see the scarlet kimono
          disappearing in the distance. A

          judicious selection of <nobr>people—the</nobr> conductor, Miss
          Debenham and <nobr>MacQueen—will</nobr> also have seen her. It was, I
          think, someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the
          scarlet kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing
          people in the <nobr>dining-car.</nobr> Where the garment came from in
          the first place, I do not know. I suspect it is the property of
          Countess Andrenyi, since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee
          so elaborate as to be rather a tea- gown than a
          <nobr>dressing-gown.</nobr>
        </p>
        <p class="p63 ft3">
          “When MacQueen first learned that the letter which had been so
          carefully burnt had in part escaped destruction, and that the word
          Armstrong was exactly the word remaining, he must at once have
          communicated his news, to the others. It was at this minute that the
          position of Countess Andrenyi became acute, and her husband
          immediately took steps to alter the passport. It was their second
          piece of bad luck!
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “They one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the
          Armstrong family. They knew I had no immediate means of finding out
          the truth, and they did not believe that I should go into the matter
          unless my suspicions were aroused against one particular person.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Now there was one further point to consider. Allowing that my theory
          of the crime was the correct one, and I believed that it
          <span class="ft4">must </span>be the correct one, then obviously the
          Wagon Lit conductor himself must be privy to the plot. But if so, that
          gave us thirteen persons, not twelve. Instead of the usual formula ‘Of
          so many people one is guilty,’ I was faced with the problem that of
          thirteen persons one and one only was innocent. Which was that person?
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “I came to a very odd conclusion. I came to the conclusion that the
          person who had taken no part in the crime was the person who would be
          considered the most likely to do so. I refer to Countess Andrenyi. I
          was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me
          solemnly on his honour that his wife never left her compartment that
          night. I decided that Count Andrenyi took, so to speak, his wife’s
          place.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “If so, then Pierre Michel was definitely one of the twelve. But how
          could one explain his complicity? He was a decent man who had been
          many years in the employ of the <nobr>company—not</nobr> the kind of
          man who could be bribed to assist in a crime. Then Pierre Michel must
          be involved in the Armstrong case. But that seemed very improbable.
          Then I remembered that the dead nursery- maid had been French.
          Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel’s
          daughter. That would explain <nobr>everything—it</nobr> would also
          explain the place chosen for the staging of the crime. Were there any
          others whose part in the drama was not clear? Colonel Arbuthnot I put
          down as a friend of the Armstrongs. They had probably been through the
          War together. The maid, Hildegarde <nobr>Schmidt—I</nobr> could guess
          her place in the Armstrong household. I am, perhaps, over greedy, but
          I sense a good cook instinctively. I laid a trap for
          <nobr>her—she</nobr> fell into it. I said I knew she was a good cook.
          She answered: ‘Yes, indeed, all my ladies have said so.’ But if you
          are employed as a <nobr><span class="ft22">lady’s-maid</span></nobr
          ><span class="ft22"> </span>your employers seldom have a chance of
          learning whether or not you are a good cook.
        </p>
        <p class="p494 ft3">
          “Then there was Hardman. He seemed quite definitely not to belong to
          the Armstrong household. I could only imagine that he had been in love
          with the French girl. I spoke to him of the charm of foreign
          <nobr>women—and</nobr> again I obtained the reaction I was looking
          for. Sudden tears came into his eyes, which he pretended were dazzled
          by the snow.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “There remains Mrs. Hubbard. Now Mrs. Hubbard, let me say, played the
          most important part in the drama. By occupying the compartment
          communicating with that of Ratchett she was more open to suspicion
          than anyone else. In the nature of things she could not have an alibi
          to fall back upon. To play the part she
          <nobr>played—the</nobr> perfectly natural, slightly ridiculous
          American fond

          <nobr>mother—an</nobr> artist was needed. But there
          <span class="ft24">was </span>an artist connected with the Armstrong
          family: Mrs. Armstrong’s <nobr>mother—Linda</nobr> Arden, the actress

        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">He stopped.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          Then in a soft rich dreamy voice, quite unlike the one she had used
          throughout the journey, Mrs. Hubbard said:
        </p>
        <p class="p496 ft5">
          “I always fancied myself in comedy parts.” She went on, still
          dreamily:
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “That slip about the <nobr>sponge-bag</nobr> was silly. It shows that
          you should always rehearse property. We tried it on the way
          <nobr>out—I</nobr> was in an <nobr>even-number</nobr> compartment
          then, I suppose. I never thought of the bolts being in different
          places.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft3">
          She shifted her position a little and looked straight at Poirot.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “You know all about it, M. Poirot. You’re a very wonderful man. But
          even you can’t quite imagine what it was <nobr>like—that</nobr> awful
          day in New York. I was just crazy with grief; so were the servants.
          And Colonel Arbuthnot was there too. He was John Armstrong’s best
          friend.”
        </p>
        <p class="p5 ft5">“He saved my life in the War,” said Arbuthnot.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “We decided then and there (perhaps we were <nobr>mad—I</nobr> don’t
          know) that the sentence of death that Cassetti had escaped had got to
          be carried out. There were twelve of <nobr>us—or</nobr> rather eleven;
          Susanne’s father was over in France, of course. First we thought we’d
          draw lots as to who should do it, but in the end we decided on this
          way. It was the chauffeur, Antonio, who suggested it. Mary worked out
          all the details later with Hector MacQueen. He’d always adored
          <nobr>Sonia—my</nobr> <nobr>daughter—and</nobr> it was he who
          explained to us exactly how Cassetti’s money had managed to get him
          off.
        </p>
        <p class="p497 ft5">
          “It took a long time to perfect our plan. We had first to track
          Ratchett down. Hardman managed that in the end. Then we had to try and
          get Masterman and Hector into his <nobr>employment—or</nobr> at any
          rate one of them. Well, we managed that. Then we had a consultation
          with Susanne’s father. Colonel Arbuthnot was very keen on having
          twelve of us. He seemed to think it made it more in order. He didn’t
          like the stabbing idea much, but he agreed that it did solve most of
          our difficulties. Well, Susanne’s father was willing. Susanne had been
          his only child. We knew from Hector that Ratchett would be coming back
          from the East sooner or later by the Orient Express. With Pierre
          Michel actually working on that train, the chance was too good to be
          missed. Besides, it would be a good way of not incriminating any
          outsiders.
        </p>
        <p class="p498 ft5">
          “My daughter’s husband had to know, of course, and he insisted on
          coming on the train with her. Hector wangled it so that Ratchett
          selected the right day for travelling, when Michel would be on duty.
          We meant to engage every carriage in the
          <nobr>Stamboul-Calais</nobr> coach, but unfortunately there was one
          carriage we couldn’t get. It had been reserved long beforehand for a
          director of the company. ‘Mr. Harris,’ of course, was a myth. But it
          would have been awkward to have any stranger in Hector’s compartment.
          And then, at the last minute, <span class="ft4">you </span>came. ...”
        </p>
        <p class="p125 ft3">She stopped.</p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Well,” she said, “you know everything now, M. Poirot. What are you
          going to do about it? If it must all come out, can’t you lay the blame
          upon me and me only? I would have stabbed that man twelve times
          willingly. It wasn’t only that he was responsible for my daughter’s
          death and her child’s and that of the other child who might have been
          alive and happy now. It was more than that: there had been other
          children kidnapped before Daisy, and there might be others in the
          future. Society had condemned <nobr>him—we</nobr> were only carrying
          out the sentence. But it’s unnecessary to bring all these others into
          it. All these good faithful <nobr>souls—and</nobr> poor
          <nobr>Michel-and</nobr> Mary and Colonel
          <nobr>Arbuthnot—they</nobr> love each other. ...”

          had thrilled many a New York audience.

        <p class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked at his friend.</p>
        <p class="p391 ft5">
          “You are a director of the company, M. Bouc,” he said. “What do you
          say?” M. Bouc cleared his throat.
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “In my opinion, M. Poirot,” he said, “the first theory you put forward
          was the correct one— decidedly so. I suggest that that is the solution
          we offer to the <nobr>Jugo-Slavian</nobr> police when they arrive. You
          agree, doctor?”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft5">
          “Certainly I agree,” said Dr. Constantine. “As regards the medical
          evidence, I <nobr>think—er—that</nobr> I made one or two fantastic
          suggestions.”
        </p>
        <p class="p4 ft3">
          “Then,” said Poirot, “having placed my solution before you, I have the
          honour to retire from the case. ...”
