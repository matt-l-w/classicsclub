<P class="p3 ft3">Agatha Christie is the world’s best known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Her writing career spanned more than half a century, during which she wrote 79 novels and short story collections, as well as 14 plays, one of which, <SPAN class="ft4">The Mousetrap</SPAN>, is the <NOBR>longest-running</NOBR> play in history. Two of the characters she created, the brilliant little Belgian Hercule Poirot and the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple, went on to become <NOBR>world-famous</NOBR> detectives. Both have been widely dramatized in feature films and <NOBR>made-for-TV</NOBR> movies.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Agatha Christie also wrote six romantic novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. As well, she wrote four nonfiction books including an autobiography and an entertaining account of the many expeditions she shared with her archaeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Agatha Christie died in 1976.</P>

<P class="p58 ft17">PART I</P>
<P class="p59 ft20">THE FACTS</P>
<P class="p60 ft21">1</P>
<P class="p61 ft11">AN IMPORTANT PASSENGER ON THE TAURUS EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p62 ft3">It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and <NOBR>dining-car,</NOBR> a <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> and two local coaches.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">By the step leading up into the <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform conversing, with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a <NOBR>pink-tipped</NOBR> nose and the two points of an <NOBR>upward-curled</NOBR> moustache.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as there always were in such cases. The <NOBR>General’s—<SPAN class="ft4">his</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> </SPAN><NOBR>General’s—temper</NOBR> had grown worse and worse. And then there had come this Belgian <NOBR>stranger—all</NOBR> the way from England, it seemed. There had been a <NOBR>week—a</NOBR> week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious faces had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the General, Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General, had suddenly looked ten years younger.</P>
<P class="p64 ft3">Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved us, <SPAN class="ft22">mon cher</SPAN>,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke. “You have saved the honour of the French <NOBR>Army—you</NOBR> have averted much bloodshed! How can I thank you for acceding to my request? To have come so <NOBR>far—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the <NOBR>phrase—“But</NOBR> indeed, do I not remember that once you saved my life?” And then the General had made another fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past service; and with more mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of honour and of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“To-day</NOBR> is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc. “Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in Stamboul.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id7_2">

<DIV id="page_8">


<DIV id="id8_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">“And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mais oui</SPAN>. Stamboul, it is a city I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through— <SPAN class="ft22">comme ça</SPAN>.” He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing <NOBR>presses—I</NOBR> shall remain there as a tourist for a few days.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, who had never seen it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to <NOBR>five—only</NOBR> five minutes more!</P>
<P class="p66 ft3">Fancying that the other man had noticed his glance, he hastened once more into speech. “There are few people travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of the</P>
<P class="p6 ft3"><NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> above them.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.</P>
<P class="p67 ft5">“Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!” “That happens?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”</P>
<P class="p68 ft5">“Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe, they are bad. “Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“In Germany, too, I have heard.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur. “Tomorrow evening at <NOBR>seven-forty</NOBR> you will be in Constantinople.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very fine.”</P>
<P class="p69 ft3">“Magnificent, I believe.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Above their heads the blinds of one of the <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> compartments was pushed aside and a young woman looked out.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday. Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment, she got up and peered out.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly lighted platform with loud, furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches. She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would not go.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an <NOBR>egg-shaped</NOBR> head he had! In spite of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled. A <NOBR>ridiculous-looking</NOBR> little man. The sort of little man one could never take seriously.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind. ...</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">En voiture, Monsieur</SPAN>,” said the Wagon Lit conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance M. Poirot climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand. Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Enfin</SPAN>!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Brrrrrrrr</SPAN>,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, realising to the full how cold he was.</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Voilà, Monsieur</SPAN>!” The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of Monsieur, I have put it here.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in it a folded note.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Merci, Monsieur</SPAN>.” The conductor became brisk and <NOBR>business-like.</NOBR> “I have the tickets of Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul, I understand?”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?” he said.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, Monsieur. I have only two other <NOBR>passengers—both</NOBR> English. A Colonel from India and a young English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Monsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There were still two hours before dawn. Conscious of an inadequate night’s sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished, M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">When he awoke it was <NOBR>half-past</NOBR> nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot coffee.</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young English lady referred to by the conductor. She was tall, slim and <NOBR>dark—perhaps</NOBR> <NOBR>twenty-eight</NOBR> years of age. There was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling. She wore a <NOBR>dark-coloured</NOBR> travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated atmosphere of the train.</P>
<P class="p63 ft23">M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect ease wherever she went. She had poise and efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her features and the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves of hair, and her <NOBR>eyes—cool,</NOBR> impersonal and grey. But she was, he decided, just a little too efficient to be what he called “<SPAN class="ft4">jolie femme</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Presently another person entered the restaurant car. This was a tall man of between forty and fifty, lean of figure, brown of skin, with hair slightly grizzled round the temples.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“The Colonel from India,” said Poirot to himself.</P>
<P class="p73 ft5">The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl. “Morning, Miss Debenham.” “Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot.”</P>
<P class="p74 ft3">The Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her. “Any objections?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Of course not. Sit down.”</P>
<P class="p75 ft5">“Well, you know, breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.” “I should hope not. But I don’t bite.”</P>
<P class="p76 ft3">The Colonel sat down. “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion. He gave an order for eggs and coffee.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot, reading the English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself. “Only some damned foreigner.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">True to their nationality, the two English people were not chatty. They exchanged a few brief remarks and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the third passenger. Their conversation was more animated than at breakfast. Colonel Arbuthnot talked of the Punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where, it became clear, she had been in a post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered some mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff. They discussed old Tommy Somebody and old Reggie Someone Else. The Colonel inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in Stamboul.</P>
<P class="p78 ft3">“No, I’m going straight on.” “Isn’t that rather a pity?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I came out this way two years ago and spent three days in Stamboul then.”</P>
<P class="p79 ft5">“Oh! I see. Well, I may say I’m very glad you are going right through, because I am.” He made a kind of clumsy little bow, flushing a little as he did so.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“He is susceptible, our Colonel,” thought Hercule Poirot to himself with some amusement. “The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”</P>
<P class="p81 ft5">Miss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive. The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician Gates, standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the girl. Poirot was</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">standing near them and heard her murmur:</P>
<P class="p82 ft3">“It’s so beautiful! I <NOBR>wish—I</NOBR> <NOBR>wish—”</NOBR> “Yes?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I wish I could enjoy it!”</P>
<P class="p83 ft5">Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer. “I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Hush, please. Hush.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed glance in Poirot’s direction. Then he went on: “But I don’t like the idea of your being a <NOBR>governess—at</NOBR> the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and their tiresome brats.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by <SPAN class="ft22">me</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.</P>
<P class="p84 ft5">“Rather an odd little comedy that I watch here,” said Poirot to himself thoughtfully. He was to remember that thought of his later.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">They arrived at Konya that night about <NOBR>half-past</NOBR> eleven. The two English travellers got out to stretch their legs, pacing up and down the snowy platform.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane. After about ten minutes, however, he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing after all. He made careful preparations, wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus attired, he descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its length. He walked out beyond the engine.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow of a traffic van. Arbuthnot was speaking.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3"><NOBR>“Mary—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The girl interrupted him.</P>
<P class="p85 ft3">“Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind <NOBR>us—<SPAN class="ft22">then</SPAN>—”</NOBR> Discreetly M. Poirot turned away. He wondered. ...</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He would hardly have recognised the cool, efficient voice of Miss Debenham. ...</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Curious,” he said to himself.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It was about <NOBR>half-past</NOBR> two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were poked out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing at something under the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man answered, and Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham who was standing just behind him.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we stopping?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire under the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure you.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as something completely unimportant.</P>
<P class="p86 ft3">“Yes, yes, I understand that. But the <SPAN class="ft22">time</SPAN>!” “The time?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, this will delay us.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“It is <NOBR>possible—yes,”</NOBR> agreed Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at 6.55, and one has to cross the Bosphorus and catch the Simplon Orient Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two of delay we shall miss the connection.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is possible, yes,” he admitted.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady; her lips, too, were trembling.</P>
<P class="p87 ft3">“Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?” he asked. “Yes. Yes, it does. <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> <SPAN class="ft22">must </SPAN>catch that train.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train started again. It arrived at <NOBR>Hayda-passar</NOBR> only five minutes late, having made up time on the journey.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from his travelling companions on the boat and did not see them again.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.</P>

<P class="p89 ft11">THE TOKATLIAN HOTEL</P>
<P class="p90 ft3">At the Tokatlian, Hercule Poirot asked for a room with bath. Then he stepped over to the concierge’s desk and inquired for letters.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">There were three waiting for him and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the telegram. It was unexpected.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He opened it in his usual neat, unhurried fashion. The printed words stood out clearly.</P>
<P class="p91 ft24">Development you predicted in Kassner case has come unexpectedly. Please return immediately.</P>
<P class="p92 ft23">“<SPAN class="ft24">Voilà ce qui est embêtant</SPAN>,” muttered Poirot vexedly. He glanced up at the clock. “I shall have to go on <NOBR>to-night,”</NOBR> he said to the concierge. “At what time does the Simplon Orient leave?”</P>
<P class="p93 ft5">“At nine o’clock, Monsieur.” “Can you get me a sleeper?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Assuredly, Monsieur. There is no difficulty this time of year. The trains are almost empty. <NOBR>First-class</NOBR> or second?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“First.”</P>
<P class="p94 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Très bien, Monsieur</SPAN>. How far are you going?” “To London.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</SPAN>. I will get you a ticket to London and reserve your <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> accommodation in the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> coach.”</P>
<P class="p84 ft5">Poirot glanced at the clock again. It was ten minutes to eight. “I have time to dine?” “But assuredly, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The little Belgian nodded. He went over and cancelled his room order and crossed the hall to the restaurant.</P>
<P class="p95 ft3">As he was giving his order to the waiter, a hand was placed on his shoulder. “Ah, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>, but this is an unexpected pleasure!” said a voice behind him.</P>
<P class="p96 ft5">The speaker was a short stout elderly man, his hair cut <SPAN class="ft4">en brosse</SPAN>. He was smiling delightedly. Poiret sprang up.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“M. Bouc!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“M. Poirot!”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">M. Bouc was a Belgian, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, and his acquaintance with the former star of the Belgian police force dated back many years.</P>
<P class="p97 ft5">“You find yourself far from home, <SPAN class="ft4">mon cher</SPAN>,” said M. Bouc. “A little affair in Syria.”</P>
<P class="p98 ft3">“Ah! and you return <NOBR>home—when?”</NOBR> <NOBR>“To-night.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Splendid! I, too. That is to say, I go as far as Lausanne, where I have affairs. You travel on the Simplon Orient, I presume?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Yes. I have just asked them to get me a sleeper. It was my intention to remain here some days, but I have. received a telegram recalling me to England on important business.”</P>

<DIV id="id13_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p99 ft23">“Ah!” sighed M. Bouc. “<SPAN class="ft24">Les </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft24">affaires—les</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft24"> affaires</SPAN>! But you, you are at the top of the tree nowadays, <SPAN class="ft24">mon vieux</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Some little success I have had, perhaps.” Hercule Poirot tried to look modest but failed signally.</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">M. Bouc laughed.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“We will meet later,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">That difficult task accomplished, he glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course. There were only about half a dozen people in the restaurant, and of those half dozen there were only two that interested Hercule Poirot.</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">These two sat at a table not far away. The younger was a <NOBR>likeable-looking</NOBR> young man of thirty, clearly an American. It was, however, not he but his companion who had attracted the little detective’s attention.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He was a man perhaps of between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly bald head, his domed forehead, the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false <NOBR>teeth—all</NOBR> seemed to speak of a benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this assumption. They were small, <NOBR>deep-set</NOBR> and crafty. Not only that. As the man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room, his gaze stopped on Poirot for a moment and just for that second there was a strange malevolence, an unnatural tensity in the glance.</P>
<P class="p101 ft3">Then he rose.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Pay the bill, Hector,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">His voice was slightly husky in tone. It had a queer, soft, dangerous quality.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">When Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge, the other two men were just leaving the hotel. Their luggage was being brought down. The younger was supervising the process. Presently he opened the glass door and said:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Quite ready now, Mr. Ratchett.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The elder man grunted an assent and passed out.</P>
<P class="p102 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>,” said Poirot. “What do you think of those two?” “They are Americans,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p103 ft3">“Assuredly they are Americans. I meant what did you think of their personalities?” “The young man seemed quite agreeable.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And the other?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“To tell you the truth, my friend, I did not care for him. He produced on me an unpleasant impression. And you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Hercule Poirot was a moment in replying.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“When he passed me in the restaurant,” he said at last, “I had a curious impression. It was as though a wild <NOBR>animal—an</NOBR> animal savage, but savage! you <NOBR>understand—had</NOBR> passed me by.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Précisément</SPAN>! The <NOBR>body—the</NOBR> <NOBR>cage—is</NOBR> everything of the most <NOBR>respectable—but</NOBR> through the bars, the wild animal looks out.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are fanciful, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“It may be so. But I could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close.”</P>
<P class="p104 ft3">“That respectable American gentleman?” “That respectable American gentleman.”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“Well,” said M. Bouc cheerfully, “it may be so. There is much evil in the world.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">At that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them. He looked concerned and apologetic.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is extraordinary, Monsieur,” he said to Poirot. “There is not one <NOBR>first-class</NOBR> sleeping berth to be had on the train.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Comment</SPAN>?” cried M. Bouc. “At this time of year? Ah, without doubt there is some party of <NOBR>journalists—of</NOBR> <NOBR>politicians—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge, turning to him respectfully. “But that’s how it is.” “Well, well.” M. Bouc turned to Poirot. “Have no fear, my friend. We will arrange something.</P>
<P class="p106 ft3">There is always one compartment, the No. 16, which is not engaged. The conductor sees to that!” He smiled, then glanced up at the clock. “Come,” he said, “it is time we started.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">At the station M. Bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the <NOBR>brown-uniformed</NOBR> Wagon Lit conductor.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Good evening, Monsieur. Your compartment is the No. 1.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft23">He called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destination:</P>
<P class="p107 ft25">ISTANBUL TRIESTE CALAIS</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“You are full up <NOBR>to-night,</NOBR> I hear?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is incredible, Monsieur. All the world elects to travel <NOBR>to-night!”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“All the same you must find room for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine. He can have the No. 16.”</P>
<P class="p109 ft5">“It is taken, Monsieur.” “What? The No. 16?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">A glance of understanding passed between them, and the conductor smiled. He was a tall sallow man of middle age.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But yes, Monsieur. As I told you, we are <NOBR>full—full—everywhere.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“But what passes itself?” demanded M. Bouc angrily. “There is a conference somewhere? It is a party?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people have elected to travel to- night.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“At Belgrade,” he said, “there will be the slip coach from Athens. There will also be the <NOBR>Bucharest-Paris</NOBR> coach. But we do not reach Belgrade until <NOBR>to-morrow</NOBR> evening. The problem is for <NOBR>to-night.</NOBR> There is no <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> berth free?”</P>
<P class="p111 ft5">“There is a <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> berth, <NOBR>Monsieur—”</NOBR> “Well, <NOBR>then—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“But it is a lady’s berth. there is already a German woman in the <NOBR>compartment—a</NOBR> lady’s maid.”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“Là- là, that is awkward,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p112 ft3">“Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said Poirot. “I must travel in an ordinary carriage.” “Not at all. Not at all.” He turned once more to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It is true,” said the man, “that there is one passenger who has not yet arrived.” He spoke slowly, with hesitation.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But speak then!”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“No. 7 <NOBR>berth—a</NOBR> <NOBR>second-class.</NOBR> The gentleman has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.”</P>
<P class="p113 ft3">“Who is it?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“An Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A M. Harris.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“A name of good omen,” said Poirot. “I read my Dickens. M. Harris he will not arrive.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Put Monsieur’s luggage in No. 7,” said M. Bouc. “If this M. Harris arrives we will tell him that he is too <NOBR>late—that</NOBR> berths cannot be retained so <NOBR>long—we</NOBR> will arrange the matter one way or another. What do I care for a M. Harris?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“As Monsieur pleases,” said the conductor. He spoke to Poirot’s porter, directing him where to go. Then he stood aside from the steps to let Poirot enter the train.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Tout à fait au bout, Monsieur</SPAN>,” he called. “The end compartment but one.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat slow progress, since most of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">His polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At last he reached the compartment indicated. Inside it, reaching up to a suitcase, was the tall young American of the Tokatlian.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He frowned as Poirot entered.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made a mistake.” Then, laboriously in French: “<SPAN class="ft22">Je crois qua vous avez un erreur</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p114 ft5">Poirot replied in English. “You are Mr. Harris?” “No, my name is MacQueen. <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">But at that moment the voice of the Wagon Lit conductor spoke from over Poirot’s <NOBR>shoulder—an</NOBR> apologetic, rather breathless voice.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“There is no other berth on the train, Monsieur. The gentleman has to come in here.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in Poirot’s luggage. Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some amusement. Doubtless the man had been</P>
<P class="p106 ft5">promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use of the other traveller. However, even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a Director of the Company is on board and issues his orders.</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">The conductor emerged from the compartment, having swung the suitcases up onto the racks. “<SPAN class="ft22">Voilà, Monsieur</SPAN>,” he said. “All is arranged. Yours is the upper berth, the No. 7. We start in</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">one minute.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He hurried off down the corridor. Poirot <NOBR>re-entered</NOBR> the compartment.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“A phenomenon I have seldom seen,” he said cheerfully. “A Wagon Lit conductor himself puts up the luggage! It is unheard of!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over his <NOBR>annoyance—had</NOBR> probably decided that it was no good to take the matter otherwise than philosophically. “The train’s remarkably full,” he said.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">A whistle blew, there was a long melancholy cry from the engine. Both men stepped out into the corridor. Outside a voice shouted, “En voiture!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“We’re off,” said MacQueen.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">But they were not quite off. The whistle blew again.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I say, sir,” said the young man suddenly. “If you’d rather have the lower <NOBR>berth—easier</NOBR> and all <NOBR>that—well,</NOBR> that’s all right by me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">A likeable young fellow.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, no,” protested Poirot. “I would not deprive <NOBR>you—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p117 ft11">POIROT REFUSES A CASE</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">M. Hercule Poirot was a little late in entering the <NOBR>luncheon-car</NOBR> on the following day. He had risen early, had breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes of the case that was recalling him to London. He had seen little of his travelling companion.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc, who was already seated, gated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found himself in the favoured position of being at the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was unusually good.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that M. Bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic.</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“Ah!” he sighed. “If I had but the pen of a Balzac! I would depict this scene.” He waved a hand.</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“It is an idea, that,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah, you agree? It has not been done, I think? And <NOBR>yet—it</NOBR> lends itself to romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several ways, never perhaps to see each other again.”</P>
<P class="p119 ft3">“And yet,” said Poirot, “suppose an <NOBR>accident—”</NOBR> “Ah, no, my <NOBR>friend—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“From your point of view it would be regrettable, I agree. But nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all these here are linked <NOBR>together—by</NOBR> death.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Some more wine,” said M. Bouc, hastily pouring it out. “You are morbid, <SPAN class="ft4">mon cher</SPAN>. It is, perhaps the digestion.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is true,” agreed Poirot, “that the food in Syria was not perhaps quite suited to my stomach.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> There were thirteen people seated there and, as M. Bouc had said, of all classes and nationalities. He began to study them.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">At the table opposite them were three men. They were, he guessed, single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A big swarthy Italian was picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him a spare neat Englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the <NOBR>well-trained</NOBR> servant. Next to the Englishman was a big American in a loud <NOBR>suit—possibly</NOBR> a commercial traveller.</P>
<P class="p120 ft3">“You’ve got to put it over <SPAN class="ft22">big</SPAN>,” he was saying in a loud, nasal voice. The Italian removed his toothpick to gesticulate with it freely. “Sure,” he said. “That whatta I say alla de time.”</P>
<P class="p121 ft3">The Englishman looked out of the window and coughed. Poirot’s eye passed on.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p99 ft5">At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of <NOBR>distinction—it</NOBR> fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright. Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which, improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small and expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow, <NOBR>toad-like</NOBR> face beneath it.</P>
<P class="p64 ft3">She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear, courteous, but completely autocratic tone.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You will be sufficiently amiable to place in my compartment a bottle of mineral water and a large glass of orange juice. You will arrange that I shall have chicken cooked without sauces for dinner this <NOBR>evening—also</NOBR> some boiled fish.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The attendant replied respectfully that it should be done.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose. Her glance caught Poirot’s and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is Princess Dragomiroff,” said M. Bouc in a low tone. “She is a Russian. Her husband realised all his money before the Revolution and invested it abroad. She is extremely rich. A cosmopolitan.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Poirot nodded. He had heard of Princess Dragomiroff.</P>
<P class="p122 ft3">“She is a personality,” said M. Bouc. “Ugly as sin but she makes herself felt. You agree?” Poirot agreed.</P>
<P class="p123 ft3">At another of the large tables Mary Debenham was sitting with two other women. One of them was tall and <NOBR>middle-aged,</NOBR> in a plaid blouse and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long mild amiable face rather like a sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, <NOBR>pleasant-faced,</NOBR> elderly person who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop.</P>
<P class="p124 ft5"><NOBR>“—and</NOBR> so my daughter said, ‘Why,’ she said, ‘you just can’t apply American methods in this country. It’s natural to the folks here to be indolent,’ she said. ‘They just haven’t got any hustle in <NOBR>them—’</NOBR> But all the same you’d be surprised to know what our college there is doing. They’ve got a fine staff of teachers. I guess there’s nothing like education. We’ve got to apply our Western ideals and teach the East to recognise them. My daughter <NOBR>says—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p125 ft3">The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm, monotonous voice was drowned.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">At the next table, a small one, sat Colonel <NOBR>Arbuthnot—alone.</NOBR> His gaze was fixed upon the back of Mary Debenham’s head. They were not sitting together. Yet it could easily have been managed. Why?</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">Perhaps, Poirot thought, Mary Debenham had demurred. A governess learns to be careful. Appearances are important. A girl with her living to get has to be discreet.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">His glance shifted to the other side of the carriage. At the far end, against the wall, was a <NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> woman dressed in black with a broad, expressionless face. German or Scandinavian, he thought. Probably the German <NOBR>lady’s-maid.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Beyond her were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man wore English clothes of loose tweed, but he was not English. Though only the back of his head was visible to Poirot, the shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well made. He turned his head suddenly and Poirot saw his profile. A very handsome man of <NOBR>thirty-odd</NOBR> with a big fair moustache.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">The woman opposite him was a mere <NOBR>girl—twenty</NOBR> at a guess. A <NOBR>tight-fitting</NOBR> little black coat and skirt, white satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous angle.</P>

<DIV id="id19_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p43 ft3">She had a beautiful <NOBR>foreign-looking</NOBR> face, dead white skin, large brown eyes, jet black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Elle est </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">jolie—et</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> chic</SPAN>,” murmured Poirot. “Husband and <NOBR>wife—eh?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">M. Bouc nodded. “Hungarian Embassy, I believe,” he said. “A handsome couple.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">There were only two more <NOBR>lunchers—Poirot’s</NOBR> fellow traveller MacQueen and his employer Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat facing Poirot, and for the second time Poirot studied that unprepossessing face, noting the false benevolence of the brow and the small, cruel eyes.</P>
<P class="p126 ft3">Doubtless M. Bouc saw a change in his friend’s expression. “It is at your wild animal you look?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot nodded.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">As his coffee was brought to him, M. Bouc rose to his feet. Having started before Poirot he had finished some time ago.</P>
<P class="p127 ft5">“I return to my compartment,” he said. “Come along presently and converse with me.” “With pleasure.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot sipped his coffee and ordered a liqueur. The attendant was passing from table to table with his box of money, accepting payment for bills. The elderly American lady’s voice rose shrill and plaintive.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“My daughter said: ‘Take a book of food tickets and you’ll have no <NOBR>trouble—no</NOBR> trouble at all.’ Now, that isn’t so. Seems they have to have a ten per cent tip, and then there’s that bottle of mineral <NOBR>water—and</NOBR> a queer sort of water too. They didn’t have any Evian or Vichy, which seems queer to me.”</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“It <NOBR>is—they</NOBR> <NOBR>must—how</NOBR> do you <NOBR>say?—serve</NOBR> the water of the country,” explained the sheep- faced lady.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, it seems queer to me.” She looked distastefully at the heap of small change on the table in front of her. “Look at all this peculiar stuff he’s given me. Dinars or something. Just a lot of rubbish, it looks like! My daughter <NOBR>said—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Mary Debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the other two. Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Gathering up her despised money the American woman followed suit, followed by the other one like a sheep. The Hungarians had already departed. The restaurant car was empty save for Poirot and Ratchett and MacQueen.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Ratchett spoke to his companion, who got up and left the car. Then he rose himself, but instead of following MacQueen he dropped unexpectedly into the seat opposite Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Can you oblige me with a light?” he said. His voice was <NOBR>soft—faintly</NOBR> nasal. “My name is Ratchett.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">Poirot bowed slightly. He slipped his hand into his pocket and produced a matchbox which he handed to the other man, who took it but did not strike a light.</P>
<P class="p128 ft3">“I think,” he went on, “that I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Hercule Poirot. Is that so?” Poirot bowed again. “You have been correctly informed, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The detective was conscious of those strange shrewd eyes summing him up before the other spoke again.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“In my country,” he said, “we come to the point quickly. Mr. Poirot, I want you to take on a job for me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Hercule Poirot’s eyebrows went up a trifle.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“My <SPAN class="ft22">clientèle</SPAN>, Monsieur, is limited nowadays. I undertake very few cases.”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“Why, naturally, I understand that. But this, Mr. Poirot, means big money.” He repeated again in his soft, persuasive voice, “Big money.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Hercule Poirot was silent a minute or two. Then he said: “What is it you wish me to do for you, <NOBR>Monsieur—er—Ratchett?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Mr. Poirot, I am a rich <NOBR>man—a</NOBR> very rich man. Men in that position have enemies. I have an enemy.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Only one enemy?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Just what do you mean by that question?” asked Ratchett sharply.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Monsieur, in my experience when a man is in a position to have, as you say, enemies, then it does not usually resolve itself into one enemy only.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Ratchett seemed relieved <NOBR>by—Poirot’s</NOBR> answer. He said quickly:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Why, yes, I appreciate that point. Enemy or <NOBR>enemies—it</NOBR> doesn’t matter. What does matter is my safety.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Safety?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“My life has been threatened, Mr. Poirot. Now I’m a man who can take pretty good care of himself.” From the pocket of his coat his hand brought a small automatic into sight for a moment. He continued grimly. “I don’t think I’m the kind of man to be caught napping. But, as I look at it, I might as well make assurance doubly sure. I fancy you’re the man for my money, Mr. Poirot. And <NOBR>remember—<SPAN class="ft4">big</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> </SPAN>money.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for some minutes. His face was completely expressionless. The other could have had no clue as to what thoughts were passing in that mind.</P>
<P class="p129 ft5">“I regret, Monsieur,” he said at length, “that I cannot oblige you.” The other looked at him shrewdly. “Name your figure, then,” he said. Poirot shook his head.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You do not understand, Monsieur. I have been very fortunate in my profession. I have made enough money to satisfy both my needs and my caprices. I take now only such cases <NOBR>as—interest</NOBR> me.”</P>
<P class="p130 ft23">“You’ve got a pretty good nerve,” said Ratchett. “Will twenty thousand dollars tempt you?” “It will not.”</P>
<P class="p131 ft5">“If you’re holding out for more, you won’t get it. I know what a thing’s worth to me.” “I, also, M. Ratchett.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What’s wrong with my proposition?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Poirot rose. “If you will forgive me for being <NOBR>personal—I</NOBR> do not like your face, M. Ratchett,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">And with that he left the restaurant car.</P>

<P class="p118 ft5">The Simplon Orient Express arrived at Belgrade at a quarter to nine that evening. It was not due to depart again until 9.15, so Poirot descended to the platform. He did not, however, remain there long. The cold was bitter, and though the platform itself was protected, heavy snow was falling outside. He returned to his compartment. The conductor, who was on the platform stamping his feet and waving his arms to keep warm, spoke to him.</P>
<P class="p64 ft3">“Your valises have been moved, Monsieur. To the compartment No. 1, the compartment of M. Bouc.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But where is Monsieur Bouc, then?”</P>
<P class="p133 ft5">“He has moved into the coach from Athens which has just been put on.” Poirot went in search of his friend. M. Bouc waved his protestations aside.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is nothing. It is nothing. It is more convenient like this. You are going through to England, so it is better that you should stay in the through coach to Calais. Me, I am very well here. It is most peaceful. This coach is empty save for myself and one little Greek doctor. Ah! my friend, what a night! They say there has not been so much snow for years. Let us hope we shall not be held up. I am not too happy about it, I can tell you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">At 9.15 punctually the train pulled out of the station, and shortly afterwards Poirot got up, said good night to his friend, and made his way along the corridor back into his own coach which was in front next to the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">On this, the second day of the journey, barriers were breaking down. Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door of his compartment talking to MacQueen. When MacQueen saw Poirot he broke off something he was saying. He looked very much surprised.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why,” he cried, “I thought you’d left us. You said you were getting off at Belgrade.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You misunderstood me,” said Poirot, smiling. “I remember now, the train started from Stamboul just as we were talking about it.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But, man, your baggage. It’s gone.”</P>
<P class="p134 ft5">“It has been moved into another compartment, that is all.” “Oh! I see.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He resumed his conversation with Arbuthnot, and Poirot passed on down the corridor.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Two doors from his own compartment, the elderly American, Mrs. Hubbard, was standing talking to the <NOBR>sheep-like</NOBR> lady, who was a Swede. Mrs. Hubbard was pressing a magazine on the other.</P>
<P class="p135 ft23">“No, do take it, my dear,” she said. “I’ve got plenty of other things to read. My, isn’t the cold something frightful?” She nodded amicably to Poirot.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You are most kind,” said the Swedish lady.</P>
<P class="p136 ft5">“Not at all. I hope you’ll sleep well and that your head will be better in the morning.” “It is the cold only. I make now myself a cup of tea.”</P>
<P class="p137 ft23">“Have you got some aspirin? Are you sure now? I’ve got plenty. Well, good night, my dear.” She turned to Poirot conversationally as the other woman departed.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p138 ft3">“Poor creature, she’s a Swede. As far as I can make out she’s a kind of missionary. A teaching one. A nice creature, but doesn’t talk much English. She was <SPAN class="ft22">most </SPAN>interested in what I told her about my daughter.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot, by now, knew all about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter. Everyone on the train who could understand English did! How she and her husband were on the staff of a big American college in Smyrna, and how this was Mrs. Hubbard’s first journey to the East, and what she thought of the Turks and their slipshod ways and the condition of their roads.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The door next to them opened and the thin pale manservant stepped out. Inside, Poirot caught a glimpse of Mr. Ratchett sitting up in bed. He saw Poirot and his face changed, darkening with anger. Then the door was shut.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard drew Poirot a little wide.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You know, I’m dead scared of that man. Oh! not the <NOBR>valet—the</NOBR> other. His master. Master, indeed! There’s something <SPAN class="ft22">wrong </SPAN>about that man. My daughter always says I’m very intuitive. ‘When Mamma gets a hunch, she’s dead right,’ that’s what my daughter says. And I’ve got a hunch about that man. He’s next door to me and I don’t like it. I put my grips against the communicating door last night. I thought I heard him trying the handle. Duo you know, I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if that man turned out to be a <NOBR>murderer—one</NOBR> of these train robbers you read about. I daresay I’m foolish, but there it is. I’m absolutely scared to death of the man! My daughter said I’d have an easy journey, but somehow I don’t feel happy about it. It may be foolish, but I feel as if anything might <NOBR>happen—anything</NOBR> at all. And how that nice young fellow can bear to be his secretary, I can’t think.”</P>
<P class="p101 ft3">Colonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming towards them down the corridor.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Come into my carriage,” MacQueen was saying. “It isn’t made up for the night yet. Now what I want to get right about your policy in India is <NOBR>this—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The two men passed and went on down the corridor to MacQueen’s carriage.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Mrs. Hubbard said good night to Poirot. “I guess I’ll go right to bed and read,” she said. “Good night.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Good night, Madame.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot passed into his own compartment, which was the next one beyond Ratchett’s. He undressed and got into bed, read for about half an hour and then turned out the light.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He awoke some hours later, awoke with a start. He knew what it was that had wakened him— a loud groan, almost a cry, somewhere close at hand. At the same moment the ting of a bell sounded sharply.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was at a standstill— presumably at a station.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">That cry had startled him. He remembered that it was Ratchett who had the next compartment. He got out of bed and opened the door just as the Wagon Lit conductor came hurrying along the corridor and knocked on Ratchett’s door. Poirot kept his door open a crack and watched. The conductor tapped a second time. A bell rang and a light showed over another door farther down. The conductor glanced over his shoulder. At the same moment a voice from within the next compartment called out: “<SPAN class="ft4">Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</SPAN>.” The conductor scurried off again, to knock at the door where the light was showing.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot returned to bed, his mind relieved, and switched off the light. He glanced at his watch. It was just <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one.</P>

<P class="p139 ft11">THE CRIME</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">He found it difficult to go to sleep again at once. For one thing he missed the motion of the train. If it <SPAN class="ft22">was </SPAN>a station outside, it was curiously quiet. By contrast the noises on the train seemed unusually loud. He could hear Ratchett moving about next <NOBR>door—a</NOBR> click as he pulled down the washbasin, the sound of the tap running, a splashing noise, then another click as the basin shut to again. Footsteps passed up the corridor outside, the shuffling footsteps of someone in bedroom slippers.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">Hercule Poirot lay awake staring at the ceiling. Why was the station outside so silent? His throat felt dry. He had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle of mineral water. He looked at his watch again. Just after a quarter past one. He would ring for the conductor and ask for some mineral water. His finger went out to the bell, but he paused as in the stillness he heard a ting. The man couldn’t answer every bell at once.</P>
<P class="p5 ft22">Ting. ... Ting. ... Ting. ...</P>
<P class="p140 ft5">It sounded again and again. Where was the man? Somebody was getting impatient. <NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">Ti-i-i-ing!</SPAN></NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Whoever it was, was keeping a finger solidly on the <NOBR>push-button.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Suddenly with a rush, his footsteps echoing up the aisle, the man came. He knocked at a door not far from Poirot’s own.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Then came <NOBR>voices—the</NOBR> conductor’s, deferential, apologetic; and a woman’s, insistent and voluble.</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard!</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot smiled to himself.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The <NOBR>altercation—if</NOBR> it was <NOBR>one—went</NOBR> on for some time. Its proportions were ninety per cent of Mrs. Hubbard’s to a soothing ten per cent of the conductor’s. Finally the matter seemed to be adjusted. Poirot heard distinctly a “<SPAN class="ft4">Bonne nuit, Madame</SPAN>,” and a closing door.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He pressed his own finger on the bell.</P>
<P class="p141 ft3">The conductor arrived promptly. He looked hot and worried. “<SPAN class="ft22">De l’eau minérale, s’il vous Plaît</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Bien, Monsieur</SPAN>.” Perhaps a twinkle in Poirot’s eye led him to unburden himself. “<SPAN class="ft4">La dame </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">américaine</SPAN>—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He wiped his forehead. “Imagine to yourself the time I have had with her! She <NOBR>insists—but</NOBR> <NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">insists</SPAN>—that</NOBR> there is a man in her compartment! Figure to yourself, Monsieur. In a space of this size.” He swept a hand round. “Where would he conceal himself? I argue with her. I point out that it is impossible. She insists. She woke up, and there was a man there. And how, I ask, did he get out and leave the door bolted behind him? But she will not listen to reason. As though there were not enough to worry us already. This <NOBR>snow—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Snow?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But yes, Monsieur. Monsieur has not noticed? The train has stopped. We have run into a snowdrift. Heaven knows how long we shall be here. I remember once being snowed up for seven days.”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“Where are we?”</P>
<P class="p142 ft3">“Between Vincovci and Brod.” <NOBR>“Là-là,”</NOBR> said Poirot vexedly.</P>
<P class="p143 ft5">The man withdrew and returned with the water. “<SPAN class="ft4">Bon soir, Monsieur</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot drank a glass of water and composed himself to sleep.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He was just dropping off when something again woke him. This time it was as though something heavy had fallen with a thud against the door.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He sprang up, opened it and looked out. Nothing. But to his right, some distance down the corridor, a woman wrapped in a scarlet kimono was retreating from him. At the other end, sitting on his little seat, the conductor was entering up figures on large sheets of paper. Everything was deathly quiet.</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“Decidedly I suffer from the nerves,” said Poirot and retired to bed again. This time he slept till morning.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">When he awoke the train was still at a standstill. He raised a blind and looked out. Heavy banks of snow surrounded the train.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He glanced at his watch and saw that it was past nine o’clock.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">At a quarter to ten, neat, spruce and dandified as ever, he made his way to the restaurant car, where a chorus of woe was going on.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Any barriers there might have been between the passengers had now quite broken down. All were united by a common misfortune. Mrs. Hubbard was loudest in her lamentations.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“My daughter said it would be the easiest way in the world. Just sit in the train until I got to Parrus. And now we may be here for days and days,” she wailed. “And my boat sails day after <NOBR>to-morrow.</NOBR> How am I going to catch it now? Why, I can’t even wire to cancel my passage. I’m just too mad to talk about it!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The Italian said that he had urgent business himself in Milan. The large American said that that was “too bad, Ma’am,” and soothingly expressed a hope that the train might make up time.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“My <NOBR>sister—her</NOBR> children wait me,” said the Swedish lady, and wept. “I get no word to them. What they think? They will say bad things have happen to me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“How long shall we be here?” demanded Mary Debenham. “Doesn’t anybody <SPAN class="ft22">know</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Her voice sounded impatient, but Poirot noted that there were no signs of that almost feverish anxiety which she had displayed during the check to the Taurus Express.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard was off again.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“There isn’t anybody knows a thing on this train. And nobody’s trying to <SPAN class="ft22">do </SPAN>anything. Just a pack of useless foreigners. Why, if this were at home, there’d be someone at least <SPAN class="ft22">trying </SPAN>to do something!”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Arbuthnot turned to Poirot and spoke in careful British French.</P>
<P class="p144 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Vous êtes un directeur de la ligne, je crois, Monsieur. Vous pouvez nous <NOBR>dire<SPAN class="ft3">—”</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft3"> Smiling, Poirot corrected him.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p145 ft3">“No, no,” he said in English. “It is not I. You confound me with my friend, M. Bouc.” “Oh, I’m sorry”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Not at all. It is most natural. I am now in the compartment that he had formerly.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">M. Bouc was not present in the restaurant car. Poirot looked about to notice who else was absent.</P>
<P class="p146 ft3">Princess Dragomiroff was missing, and the Hungarian couple. Also Ratchett, his valet, and the German <NOBR>lady’s-maid.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p65 ft3">The Swedish lady wiped her eyes.</P>
<P class="p147 ft3">“I am foolish,” she said. “I am bad to cry. All is for the best, whatever happen.” This Christian spirit, however, was far from being shared.</P>
<P class="p148 ft5">“That’s all very well,” said MacQueen restlessly. “We may be here for days.” “What <SPAN class="ft4">is </SPAN>this country anyway?” demanded Mrs. Hubbard tearfully.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">On being told it was <NOBR>Jugo-Slavia,</NOBR> she said: “Oh! one of these Balkan things. What can you expect?”</P>
<P class="p149 ft3">“You are the only patient one, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot to Miss Debenham. She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “What can one do?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are a philosopher, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That implies a detached attitude. I think my attitude is more selfish. I have learned to save myself useless emotion.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She was speaking more to herself than to him. She was not even looking at him. Her gaze went past him, out of the window to where the snow lay in heavy masses.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You are a strong character, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “You are, I think, the strongest character amongst us.”</P>
<P class="p97 ft3">“Oh! no. No, indeed. I know one far, far stronger than I am.” “And that <NOBR>is—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She seemed suddenly to come to herself, to realise that she was talking to a stranger and foreigner, with whom, until this morning, she had exchanged only half a dozen sentences.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She laughed, a polite but estranging laugh.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“Well—that</NOBR> old lady, for instance. You have probably noticed her. A very ugly old lady but rather fascinating. She has only to lift a little finger and ask for something in a polite <NOBR>voice—and</NOBR> the whole train runs.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It runs also for my friend M. Bouc,” said Poirot. “But that is because he is a director of the line, not because he has a strong character.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Mary Debenham smiled.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The morning wore away. Several people, Poirot amongst them, remained in the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> The communal life was felt, at the moment, to pass the time better. He heard a good deal more about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter, and he heard the lifelong habits of Mr. Hubbard, deceased, from his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with a cereal to his final rest at night in the <NOBR>bed-socks</NOBR> that Mrs. Hubbard herself had been in the habit of knitting for him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">It was when he was listening to a confused account of the missionary aims of the Swedish lady that one of the Wagon Lit conductors came into the car and stood at his elbow.</P>
<P class="p150 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Pardon, Monsieur<SPAN class="ft3">.” “Yes?”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“The compliments of M. Bouc, and he would be glad if you would be so kind as to come to him for a few minutes.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Poirot rose, uttered excuses to the Swedish lady and followed the man out of the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> It was not his own conductor, but a big fair man.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">He followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage and along the corridor of the next one. The man tapped at a door, then stood aside to let Poirot enter.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The compartment was not M. Bouc’s own. It was a <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> <NOBR>one—chosen</NOBR> presumably because of its slightly larger size. It certainly gave the impression of being crowded.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">M. Bouc himself was sitting on the small seat in the opposite corner. In the corner next the window, facing him, was a small dark man looking out at the snow. Standing up and quite</P>

<P class="p151 ft23">preventing Poirot from advancing any farther were a big man in blue uniform (the <SPAN class="ft24">chef de train</SPAN>) and his own Wagon Lit conductor.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Ah! my good friend,” cried M. Bouc. “Come in. We have need of you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The little man in the window shifted along the seat, and Poirot squeezed past: the other two men and sat down facing his friend.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The expression on M. Bouc’s face gave him, as he would have expressed it, furiously to think. It was clear that something out of the common had happened.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What has occurred?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You may well ask that. First this <NOBR>snow-this</NOBR> stoppage. And <NOBR>now—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p152 ft5">He <NOBR>paused—and</NOBR> a sort of strangled gasp came from the Wagon Lit conductor. “And now what?”</P>
<P class="p75 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>And now a passenger lies dead in his <NOBR>berth—stabbed<SPAN class="ft3">.”</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft3"> M. Bouc spoke with a kind of calm desperation.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“A passenger? Which passenger?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“An American. A man <NOBR>called—called—”</NOBR> he consulted some notes in front of him. “Ratchett. That is <NOBR>right—Ratchett?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p94 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur,” the Wagon Lit man gulped. Poirot looked at him. He was as white as chalk.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You had better let that man sit down,” he said. “He may faint otherwise.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>moved slightly and the Wagon Lit man sank down in the corner and buried his face in his hands.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Brr</SPAN>!” said Poirot. “This is serious!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Certainly it is serious. To begin with, a <NOBR>murder—that</NOBR> in itself is a calamity of the first water. But not only that, the circumstances are unusual. Here we are, brought to a standstill. We may be here for <NOBR>hours—and</NOBR> not only <NOBR>hours—days!</NOBR> Another <NOBR>circumstance—passing</NOBR> through most countries we have the police of that country on the train. But in <NOBR>Jugo-Slavia,</NOBR> no. You comprehend?”</P>
<P class="p153 ft3">“It is a position of great difficulty,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“There is worse to come. Dr. <NOBR>Constantine—I</NOBR> forgot, I have not introduced you. Dr. Constantine, M. Poirot.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The little dark man bowed, and Poirot returned the bow.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Dr. Constantine is of the opinion that death occurred at about 1 A.M.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is difficult to speak exactly in these matters,” said the doctor, “but I think I can say definitely that death occurred between midnight and two in the morning.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“When was this M. Ratchett last seen alive?” asked Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“He is known to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one, when he spoke to the conductor,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is quite correct,” said Poirot. “I myself heard what passed. That is the last thing known?”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">Poirot turned toward the doctor, who continued.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The window of M. Ratchett’s compartment was found wide open, leading one to suppose that the murderer escaped that way. But in my opinion that open window is a blind. Anyone departing that way would have left distinct traces in the snow. There were none.”</P>
<P class="p155 ft3">“The crime was <NOBR>discovered—when?”</NOBR> asked Poirot. “Michel!”</P>

<P class="p156 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor sat up. His face still looked pale and frightened. “Tell this gentleman exactly what occurred,” ordered M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The man spoke somewhat jerkily.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The valet of this M. Ratchett, he tapped several times at the door this morning. There was no answer. Then, half an hour ago, the restaurant car attendant came. He wanted to know if Monsieur was taking <SPAN class="ft4">déjeuner</SPAN>. It was eleven o’clock, you comprehend.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I open the door for him with my key. But there is a chain, too, and that is fastened. There is no answer and it is very still in there, and <NOBR>cold—but</NOBR> cold. With the window open and snow drifting in. I thought the gentleman had had a fit, perhaps. I got the <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train</SPAN>. We broke the chain and went in. He <NOBR>was—<SPAN class="ft4">Ah!</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> c’était terrible</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">He buried his face in his hands again.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“The door was locked and chained on the inside,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “It was not <NOBR>suicide—eh?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p71 ft3">The Greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh. “Does a man who commits suicide stab himself in <NOBR>ten—twelve—fifteen</NOBR> places?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot’s eyes opened. “That is great ferocity,” he said.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is a woman,” said the <SPAN class="ft22">chef de train</SPAN>, speaking for the first time. “Depend upon it, it was a woman. Only a woman would stab like that.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Dr. Constantine screwed up his face thoughtfully.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“She must have been a very strong woman,” he said. “It is not my desire to speak <NOBR>technically—that</NOBR> is only confusing; but I can assure you that one or two of the blows were delivered with such force as to drive them through hard belts of bone and muscle.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It was clearly not a scientific crime,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It was most unscientific,” returned Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem to have been delivered haphazard and at random. Some have glanced off, doing hardly any damage. It is as though somebody had shut his eyes and then in a frenzy struck blindly again and again.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">C’est une femme</SPAN>,” said the <SPAN class="ft22">chef de train </SPAN>again. “Women are like that. When they are enraged they have great strength.” He nodded so sagely that everyone suspected a personal experience of his own.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I have, perhaps, something to contribute to your store of knowledge,” said Poirot. “M. Ratchett spoke to me yesterday. He told me, as far as I was able to understand him, that he was in danger of his life.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft26">‘Bumped </SPAN><NOBR>off’—that</NOBR> is the American expression, is it not?” asked M. Bouc. “Then it is not a woman. It is a ‘gangster’ or a ‘gunman.’ ”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>looked pained at seeing his theory come to nought.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“If so,” said Poirot, “it seems to have been done very amateurishly.” His tone expressed professional disapproval.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There is a large American on the train,.” said M. Bouc, pursuing his idea. “A common- looking man with terrible clothes. He chews the gum, which I believe is not done in good circles. You know whom I mean?”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor to whom he had appealed nodded.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Oui, Monsieur</SPAN>, the No. 16. But it cannot have been he. I should have seen him enter or leave the compartment.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“You might not. You might not. But we will go into that presently. The question is, what to do?” He looked at Poirot.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked back at him.</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“Come, my friend,” said M. Bouc. “You comprehend what I am about to ask of you. I know your powers. Take command of this investigation! No, no, do not refuse. See, to us it is <NOBR>serious—I</NOBR> speak for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. By the time the Jugo- Slavian police arrive, how simple if we can present them with the solution! Otherwise delays, annoyances, a million and one inconveniences. Perhaps, who knows, serious annoyance to innocent persons. <NOBR>Instead—<SPAN class="ft22">you</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> </SPAN>solve the mystery! We say, ‘A murder has <NOBR>occurred—<SPAN class="ft22">this</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> </SPAN>is the criminal!’”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“And suppose I do not solve it?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Ah, <SPAN class="ft22">mon cher</SPAN>!” M. Bouc’s voice became positively caressing. “I know your reputation. I know something of your methods. This is the ideal case for you. To look up the antecedents of all these people, to discover their <SPAN class="ft22">bona </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">fides</SPAN>—all</NOBR> that takes time and endless inconvenience. But have I not heard you say often that to solve a case a man has only to lie back in his chair and think? Do that. Interview the passengers on the train, view the body, examine what clues there are, and <NOBR>then—well,</NOBR> I have faith in you! I am assured that it is no idle boast of yours. Lie back and <NOBR>think—use</NOBR> (as I have heard you say so often) the little grey cells of the <NOBR>mind—and</NOBR> you will <SPAN class="ft22">know</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p101 ft3">He leaned forward, looking affectionately at the detective.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Your faith touches me, my friend,” said Poirot emotionally. “As you say, this cannot be a difficult case. I myself last <NOBR>night—but</NOBR> we will not speak of that now. In truth, this problem intrigues me. I was reflecting, not half an hour ago, that many hours of boredom lay ahead whilst we are stuck here. And <NOBR>now—a</NOBR> problem lies ready to my hand.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You accept then?” said M. Bouc eagerly.</P>
<P class="p157 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">C’est entendu</SPAN>. You place the matter in my hands.” <NOBR>“Good—we</NOBR> are all at your service.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“To begin with, I should like a plan of the <NOBR>Istanbul-Calais</NOBR> coach, with a note of the people who occupied the several compartments, and I should also like to see their passports and their tickets.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Michel will get you those.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor left the compartment.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What other passengers are there on the train?” asked Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“In this coach Dr. Constantine and I are the only travellers. In the coach from Bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg. He is well known to the conductor. Beyond that are the ordinary carriages, but these do not concern us, since they were locked after dinner had been served last night. Forward of the <NOBR>Istanbul-Calais</NOBR> coach there is only the <NOBR>dining-car.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Then it seems,” said Poirot slowly, “as though we must look for our murderer in the <NOBR>Istanbul-Calais</NOBR> coach.” He turned to the doctor. “That is what you were hinting, I think?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The Greek nodded. “At half an hour after midnight we ran into the snowdrift. No one can have left the train since then.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">M. Bouc said solemnly, “</SPAN>The murderer is with <NOBR>us—on</NOBR> the train now<SPAN class="ft3">. ...”</SPAN></P>

<P class="p158 ft11">A WOMAN</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">“First of all,” said Poirot, “I should like a word or two with young Mr. MacQueen. He may be able to give us valuable information.”</P>
<P class="p160 ft5">“Certainly,” said M. Bouc. He turned to the <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train</SPAN>. “Get Mr. MacQueen to come here.” The <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>left the carriage.</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">The conductor returned with a bundle of passports and tickets. M. Bouc took them from him. “Thank you, Michel. It would be best now, I think, if you were to go back to your post. We</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">will take your evidence formally later.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Very good, Monsieur,” said Michel, and in his turn left the carriage.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“After we have seen young MacQueen,” said Poirot, “perhaps <SPAN class="ft4">M. le docteur </SPAN>will come with me to the dead man’s carriage.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Certainly.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“After we have finished <NOBR>there—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">But at this moment the <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>returned with Hector MacQueen.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc rose. “We are a little cramped here,” he said pleasantly. “Take my seat, Mr. MacQueen. M. Poirot will sit opposite <NOBR>you—so.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He turned to the <SPAN class="ft22">chef de train</SPAN>. “Clear all the people out of the restaurant car,” he said, “and let it be left free for M. Poirot. You will conduct your interviews there, <SPAN class="ft22">mon cher</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“It would be the most convenient, yes,” agreed Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">MacQueen had stood looking from one to the other, not quite following the rapid flow of French.</P>
<P class="p72 ft3"><NOBR>“<SPAN class="ft22">Qu’est-ce</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> qu’il y a</SPAN>?” he began laboriously. <NOBR>“<SPAN class="ft22">Pourquoi</SPAN>—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">With a vigorous gesture Poirot motioned him to the seat in the corner. He took it and began once more.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3"><NOBR>“<SPAN class="ft22">Pourquoi</SPAN>—?”</NOBR> Then checking himself and relapsing into his own tongue: “What’s up on the train? Has anything happened?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He looked from one man to another.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot nodded. “Exactly. Something has happened. Prepare yourself for a shock. <SPAN class="ft4">Your employer, M. Ratchett, is dead</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">MacQueen’s mouth pursed itself into a whistle. Except that his eyes grew a shade brighter, he showed no signs of shock or distress.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“So they got him after all,” he said.</P>
<P class="p161 ft5">“What exactly do you mean by that phrase, Mr. MacQueen?” MacQueen hesitated.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are assuming,” said Poirot, “that M. Ratchett was murdered?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Wasn’t he?” This time MacQueen did show surprise. “Why, yes,” he said slowly. “That’s just what I did think. Do you mean he just died in his sleep? Why, the old man was as tough as— as <NOBR>tough—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p72 ft3">He stopped, at a loss for a simile.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, no,” said Poirot. “Your assumption was quite right. M. Ratchett was murdered. Stabbed. But I should like to know why you were so sure it <SPAN class="ft22">was </SPAN>murder, and not <NOBR>just—death.”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p77 ft3">MacQueen hesitated. “I must get this clear,” he said. “Who exactly are you? And where do you come in?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I represent the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.” Poirot paused, then added, “I am a detective. My name is Hercule Poirot.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">If he expected an effect he did not get one. MacQueen said merely, “Oh! yes?” and waited for him to go on.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You know the name perhaps?”</P>
<P class="p162 ft5">“Why, it does seem kind of familiar. Only I always thought it was a woman’s dressmaker.” Hercule Poirot looked at him with distaste. “It is incredible!” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What’s incredible?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Nothing. Let us advance with the matter in hand. I want you to tell me, M. MacQueen, all that you know about the dead man. You were not related to him?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No. I <NOBR>am—was—his</NOBR> secretary.”</P>
<P class="p163 ft5">“For how long have you held that post?” “Just over a year.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Please give me all the information you can.”</P>
<P class="p85 ft3">“Well, I met Mr. Ratchett just over a year ago when I was in <NOBR>Persia—”</NOBR> Poirot interrupted.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“What were you doing there?’</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I had come over from New York to look into an oil concession. I don’t suppose you want to hear all about that. My friends and I had been let in rather badly over it. Mr. Ratchett was in the same hotel. He had just had a row with his secretary. He offered me the job and I took it. I was at a loose end and glad to find a <NOBR>well-paid</NOBR> job ready made, as it were.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And since then?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“We’ve travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than as a secretary. It was a pleasant life.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Now tell me as much as you can about your employer.”</P>
<P class="p164 ft5">The young man shrugged his shoulders. A perplexed expression passed over his face. “That’s not so easy.”</P>
<P class="p165 ft3">“What was his full name?” “Samuel Edward Ratchett.” “He was an American citizen?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft3">“What part of America did he come from?” “I don’t know.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Well, tell me what you do know.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“The actual truth is, Mr. Poirot, that I know nothing at all! Mr. Ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in America.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Why do you think that was?”</P>
<P class="p167 ft5">“I don’t know. I imagined that he might be ashamed of his beginnings. Some men are.” “Does that strike you as a satisfactory solution?”</P>
<P class="p168 ft5">“Frankly, it doesn’t.” “Has he any relatives?” “He never mentioned any.” Poirot pressed the point.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You must have formed <SPAN class="ft22">some </SPAN>theory, Mr. MacQueen.”</P>

<DIV id="id31_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p138 ft3">“Well, Yes, I did. For one thing, I don’t believe Ratchett was his real name. I think he left America definitely in order to escape someone or something. I think he was <NOBR>successful—until</NOBR> a few weeks ago.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“And then?”</P>
<P class="p169 ft3">“He began to get <NOBR>letters—threatening</NOBR> letters.” “Did you see them?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes. It was my business to attend to his correspondence. The first letter came a fortnight ago.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Were these letters destroyed?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, I think I’ve got a couple still in my <NOBR>files—one</NOBR> I know Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall I get them for you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“If you would be so good.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">MacQueen left the compartment. He returned a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of rather dirty notepaper before Poirot.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The first letter ran as follows:</P>
<P class="p91 ft22">Thought you’d <NOBR>double-cross</NOBR> us and get away with it, did you? Not on your life. We’re out to GET you, Ratchett, and we WILL get you!</P>
<P class="p170 ft3">There was no signature.</P>
<P class="p171 ft3">With no comment beyond raised eyebrows, Poirot picked up the second letter.</P>
<P class="p91 ft24">We’re going to take you for a ride, Ratchett. Some time soon. We’re going to GET you— see?</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Poirot laid the letter down.</P>
<P class="p172 ft3">“The style is monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.” MacQueen stared at him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You would not observe,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It requires the eye of one used to such things. This letter was not written by one person, M. MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it— each writing one letter of a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That makes the task of identifying the handwriting much more difficult.” He paused, then said: “Did you know that M. Ratchett had applied for help to me?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“To <SPAN class="ft22">you</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly that the young man had not known of</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The detective nodded. “Yes. He was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act when he received the first letter?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">MacQueen hesitated.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It’s difficult to say. <NOBR>He—he—passed</NOBR> it off with a laugh in that quiet way of his. But <NOBR>somehow—”</NOBR> he gave a slight <NOBR>shiver—“I</NOBR> felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the quietness.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Mr. MacQueen, will you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer? Did you like him?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.</P>

<P class="p173 ft3">“No,” he said at last. “I did not.” “Why.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I can’t exactly say. He was always quite pleasant in his manner.” He paused, then said: “I’ll tell you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I disliked and distrusted him. He was, I am sure, a cruel and dangerous man. I must admit, though, that I have no reasons to advance for my opinion.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One further question: when did you last see Mr. Ratchett alive?” “Last evening <NOBR>about—”</NOBR> he thought for a <NOBR>minute—“ten</NOBR> o’clock, I should say. I went into his</P>
<P class="p174 ft3">compartment to take down some memoranda from him.” “On what subject?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought in Persia. What had been delivered was not what he had purchased. There has been a long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.”</P>
<P class="p175 ft3">“And that was the last time Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?” “Yes, I suppose so.”</P>
<P class="p85 ft5">“Do you know when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?” “On the morning of the day we left Constantinople.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“There is one more question I must ask you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with your employer?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“This is where I’m supposed to go all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best seller, ‘You’ve nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I were on perfectly good terms.”</P>
<P class="p176 ft3">“Perhaps, Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your address in America.” MacQueen gave his <NOBR>name—Hector</NOBR> Willard <NOBR>MacQueen—and</NOBR> an address in New York. Poirot leaned back against the cushions.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That is all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be obliged if you would keep the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little time.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“His valet, Masterman, will have to know.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“He probably knows already,” said Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him to hold his tongue.” “That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher and, as he calls it, he ‘keeps to himself.’ He has</P>
<P class="p177 ft5">a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at all of any other nationality.” “Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The American left the carriage.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says, this young man?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“He seems honest and straightforward. He did not pretend to any affection for his employer, as he probably would have done had he been involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed, but I do not think that that is really a suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr. Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on every possible occasion.”</P>
<P class="p178 ft3">“So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,” said M. Bouc jovially. Poirot cast on him a look of reproach.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Me, I suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same, I must admit that I cannot see this sober, <NOBR>long-headed</NOBR> MacQueen losing his head and stabbing his victim twelve or fourteen times. It is not in accord with his <NOBR>psychology—not</NOBR> at all.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “That is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a frenzied <NOBR>hate—it</NOBR> suggests rather the Latin temperament. Or else it suggests, as our friend the <SPAN class="ft22">chef de train </SPAN><NOBR>insisted—a</NOBR> woman.”</P>

<P class="p179 ft11">THE BODY</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">Followed by Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his way to the next coach and to the compartment occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came and unlocked the door for them with his key.</P>
<P class="p180 ft3">The two men passed inside. Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion. “How much has been disarranged in this compartment?”</P>
<P class="p181 ft3">“Nothing has been touched. I was careful not to move the body in making my examination.” Poirot nodded. He looked round him.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold. The window was pushed down as far as it would go, and the blind was drawn up.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Brrr</SPAN>,” observed Poirot.</P>
<P class="p182 ft5">The other smiled appreciatively. “I did not like to close it,” he said. Poirot examined the window carefully.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the carriage this way. Possibly the open window was intended to suggest that somebody did; but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s intention.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft23">He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a small case from his pocket he blew a little powder over the frame.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped. Well, if there had been fingerprints they would have told us very little. They would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or his valet or the conductor. Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And that being so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the window. Positively it is the cold storage in here!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the motionless figure lying in the bunk.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned and thrown back.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I had to see the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the doctor.</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">Poirot nodded. He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself with a slight grimace. “It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again.</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">How many wounds are there exactly?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I make it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches. On the other hand, at least three would be capable of causing death.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s attention. He looked at him sharply. The little Greek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked gently. “Speak, my friend. There is something here that puzzles you?”</P>
<P class="p183 ft3">“You are right,” acknowledged the other. “What is it?”</P>

<P class="p138 ft3">“You see these two <NOBR>wounds—here</NOBR> and <NOBR>here—”</NOBR> He pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must have severed blood <NOBR>vessels—and</NOBR> yet the edges do not gape. They have not bled as one would have expected.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Which suggests?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That the man was already <NOBR>dead—some</NOBR> little time <NOBR>dead—when</NOBR> they were delivered. But that is surely absurd.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he had not accomplished his job properly and came back to make quite <NOBR>sure—but</NOBR> that is manifestly absurd! Anything else?”</P>
<P class="p184 ft3">“Well, just one thing.” “And that?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You see this wound <NOBR>here—under</NOBR> the right <NOBR>arm—near</NOBR> the right shoulder. Take this pencil of mine. Could you deliver such a blow?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Poirot poised his hand.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Précisément</SPAN>,” he said. “I see. With the <SPAN class="ft22">right </SPAN>hand it is exceedingly difficult, almost impossible. One would have to strike backhanded, as it were. But if the blow were struck with the <SPAN class="ft22">left </SPAN><NOBR>hand—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p185 ft3">“Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the <SPAN class="ft22">left </SPAN>hand.” “So that our murderer is <NOBR>left-handed?</NOBR> No, it is more difficult than that, is it not?” “As you say, M. Poirot. Some of these other blows are just as obviously <NOBR>right-handed.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Two people. We are back at two people again,” murmured the detective. He asked abruptly: “Was the electric light on?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten o’clock.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“The switches will tell us,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He examined the switch of the top light and also the <NOBR>roll-back</NOBR> <NOBR>bed-head</NOBR> light. The former was turned off. The latter was closed.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Eh bien</SPAN>,” he said thoughtfully. “We have here a hypothesis of the First and the Second Murderer, as the great Shakespeare would put it. The First Murderer stabbed his victim and left the compartment, turning off the light. The Second Murderer came in in the dark, did not see that his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a dead body. <SPAN class="ft22">Que </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">pensez-vous</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> de ça</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p186 ft23">“Magnificent!” said the little doctor with enthusiasm. The other’s eyes twinkled.</P>
<P class="p187 ft5">“You think so? I am glad. It sounded to me a little like the nonsense.” “What other explanation can there be?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is just what I am asking myself. Have we here a coincidence, or what? Are there any other inconsistencies, such as would point to two people being concerned?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I think I can say yes. Some of these blows, as I have already said, point to a <NOBR>weakness—a</NOBR> lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing blows. But this one here— and this <NOBR>one—”</NOBR> Again he pointed. “Great strength was needed for those blows. They have penetrated the muscle.”</P>
<P class="p155 ft3">“They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?” “Most certainly.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“They could not have been delivered by a woman?”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“A young, vigorous, athletic woman might have struck them, especially if she were in the grip of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion highly unlikely.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot was silent a moment or two.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The other asked anxiously, “You understand my point?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The matter begins to clear itself up wonderfully! The murderer was a man of great <NOBR>strength—he</NOBR> was <NOBR>feeble—it</NOBR> was a <NOBR>woman—it</NOBR> was a <NOBR>right-handed</NOBR> <NOBR>person—it</NOBR> was a <NOBR>left-handed</NOBR> person. <SPAN class="ft4">Ah! c’est rigolo, tout ça</SPAN>!” He spoke with sudden anger. “And the victim— what does he do in all this? Does he cry out? Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He slipped his hand under the pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which Ratchett had shown him the day before.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Fully loaded, you see,” he said.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">They looked round them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall. On the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various objects. False teeth in a glass of water. Another glass, empty. A bottle of mineral water. A large flask. An <NOBR>ash-tray</NOBR> containing the butt of a cigar and some charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it.</P>
<P class="p188 ft3">“Here is the explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly. “Drugged?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p189 ft5">Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them carefully. “You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Those two matches are of different shapes,” said Poirot. “One is flatter than the other. You see?”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“It is the kind you get on the train,” said the doctor. “In paper covers.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot was feeling in the pockets of Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of matches. He compared them carefully with the burnt ones.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“The rounder one is a match struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the flatter kind.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">But a further search showed no other matches.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot’s eyes were darting about the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s. One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">With a little exclamation he bent and <NOBR>picked-up</NOBR> something from the floor.</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">It was a small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an embroidered <NOBR>initial—H.</NOBR> “A woman’s handkerchief,” said the doctor. “Our friend the <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>was right. There is a</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">woman concerned in this.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly as it happens in the books and on the <NOBR>films—and</NOBR> to make things even easier for us, it is marked with an initial.”</P>
<P class="p190 ft3">“What a stroke of luck for us!” exclaimed the doctor. “Is it not?” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Something in his tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask for elucidation Poirot had made another dive onto the floor.</P>
<P class="p191 ft5">This time he held out on the palm of his <NOBR>hand—a</NOBR> <NOBR>pipe-cleaner.</NOBR> “It is perhaps the property of Mr. Ratchett?” suggested the doctor.</P>
<P class="p192 ft3">“There was no pipe in any of his pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco pouch.” “Then it is a clue.”</P>

<P class="p138 ft3">“Oh! decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this time, you note! One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance. By the way, what have you done with the weapon?”</P>
<P class="p79 ft5">“There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have taken it away with him.” “I wonder why,” mused Poirot.</P>
<P class="p193 ft5">“Ah!” The doctor had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man. “I overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket and threw it straight back.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The case was dented savagely, and the hands pointed to a quarter past one.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the crime. It agrees with my calculations. Between midnight and two in the morning is what I said, and probably about one o’clock, though it is difficult to be exact in these matters. <SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>, here is confirmation. A quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is possible, yes. It is certainly possible.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will pardon me, M. Poirot, but I do not quite understand you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I do not understand myself,” said Poirot. “I understand nothing at all. And, as you perceive, it worries me.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He sighed and bent over the little table examining the charred fragment of paper. He murmured to himself, “What I need at this moment is an <NOBR>old-fashioned</NOBR> woman’s <NOBR>hat-box.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Dr. Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark. In any case Poirot gave him no time for questions. Opening the door into the corridor, he called for the conductor.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The man arrived at a run.</P>
<P class="p194 ft5">“How many women are there in this coach?” The conductor counted on his fingers.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“One, two, <NOBR>three—six,</NOBR> Monsieur. The old American lady, a Swedish lady, the young English lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot considered.</P>
<P class="p195 ft5">“They all have <NOBR>hat-boxes,</NOBR> yes?” “Yes, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Then bring <NOBR>me—let</NOBR> me <NOBR>see—yes,</NOBR> the Swedish lady’s and that of the <NOBR>lady’s-maid.</NOBR> Those two are the only hope. You will tell them it is a customs <NOBR>regulation—something—anything</NOBR> that occurs to you.”</P>
<P class="p196 ft3">“That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither lady is in her compartment at the moment.” “Then be quick.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened that of the maid, and tossed it aside. Then he opened the Swedish lady’s and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully, he disclosed round humps of <NOBR>wire-netting.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah, here is what we need! About fifteen years ago <NOBR>hat-boxes</NOBR> were made like this. You skewered through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of <NOBR>wire-netting.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">As he spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then he repacked the hat- box and told the conductor to return both boxes where they belonged.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">When the door was shut once more he turned to his companion.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome a</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not quite understand you, M. Poirot.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, to give you an <NOBR>example—we</NOBR> find a woman’s handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or did a man, committing the crime, say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I will stab my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows feeble and ineffective, and I will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss it’? That is one possibility. Then there is another. Did a woman kill him, and did she deliberately drop a <NOBR>pipe-cleaner</NOBR> to make it look like a man’s work? Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a woman, were separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her identity? It is a little too much of a coincidence, that!”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“But where does the <NOBR>hat-box</NOBR> come in?” asked the doctor, still puzzled.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these <NOBR>clues—the</NOBR> watch stopped at a quarter past one, the handkerchief, the <NOBR>pipe-cleaner—they</NOBR> may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that I cannot yet tell. But there is one clue here <NOBR>which—though</NOBR> again I may be <NOBR>wrong—I</NOBR> believe has not been faked. I mean this flat match, <SPAN class="ft4">M. le docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer, not by Mr. Ratchett</SPAN>. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind. Possibly a note. If so, there was something in that note, some mistake, some error, that left a possible clue to the assailant. I am going to try to discover what that something was.”</P>
<P class="p198 ft23">He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of <NOBR>curling-tongs.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to the latter.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened out the two humps of wire, and with great care wriggled the charred scrap of paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on top of it and then, holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing over the flame of the <NOBR>spirit-lamp.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“It is a very makeshift affair, this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer our purpose.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal began to glow. Suddenly he saw faint indications of letters. Words formed themselves <NOBR>slowly-words</NOBR> of fire.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">It was a very tiny scrap. Only three words and part of another showed.</P>
<P class="p199 ft22"><NOBR>—member</NOBR> little Daisy Armstrong</P>
<P class="p200 ft3">“Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. “It tells you something?” asked the doctor.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs carefully.</P>
<P class="p83 ft4"><SPAN class="ft5">“Yes,” he said. “</SPAN>I know the dead man’s real name. I know why he had to leave America<SPAN class="ft5">.” “What was his name?”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Cassetti.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Cassetti?” Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me something. Some years ago. I cannot remember. ... It was a case in America, was it not?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Further than that Poirot was not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him as he went on:</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“We will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be seen here.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Quickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but found nothing there of interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next compartment, but it was bolted on the other side.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“There is one thing that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine. “If the murderer did not escape through the window, and if this communicating door was bolted on the other side, and if the door into the corridor was not only locked on the inside but chained, how then did the murderer leave the compartment?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That is what the audience says when a person bound hand and foot is shut into a cabinet— and disappears.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You <NOBR>mean—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I mean,” explained Poirot, “that if the murderer intended us to believe that he had escaped by way of the window, he would naturally make it appear that the other two exits were impossible. Like the ‘disappearing person’ in the cabinet, it is a trick. It is our business to find out how the trick is done.</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">He locked the communicating door on their <NOBR>side—“in</NOBR> case,” he said, “the excellent Mrs. Hubbard should take it into her head to acquire <NOBR>first-hand</NOBR> details of the crime to write to her daughter.”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">He looked round once more.</P>

<P class="p4 ft3">“I thought it best to have lunch served immediately in the restaurant car,” he said. “Afterwards it will be cleared and M. Poirot can conduct his examination of the passengers there. In the meantime I have ordered them to bring us three some food here.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“An excellent idea,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">None of the three men was hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not till they were sipping their coffee did M. Bouc mention the subject that was occupying all their minds.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Eh bien</SPAN>?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>, I have discovered the identity of the victim. I know why it was imperative he should leave America.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Who was he?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Do you remember reading of the Armstrong baby? This is the man who murdered little Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I recall it now. A shocking <NOBR>affair—though</NOBR> I cannot remember the details.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Colonel Armstrong was an <NOBR>Englishman—a</NOBR> V.C. He was half American, his mother having been a daughter of W. K. Van der Halt, the Wall Street millionaire. He married the daughter of Linda Arden, the most famous tragic American actress of her day. They lived in America and had one <NOBR>child—a</NOBR> girl whom they idolized. When she was three years old she was kidnapped, and an impossibly high sum demanded as the price of her return. I will not weary you with all the intricacies that followed. I will come to the moment when, after the parents had paid over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars, the child’s dead body was discovered; it had been dead for at least a fortnight. Public indignation rose to fever point. And there was worse to follow. Mrs. Armstrong was expecting another baby. Following the shock of the discovery, she gave birth prematurely to a dead child, and herself died. Her <NOBR>broken-hearted</NOBR> husband shot himself.”</P>
<P class="p203 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mon Dieu</SPAN>, what a tragedy. I remember now,” said M. Bouc. “There was also another death, if I remember rightly?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes, an unfortunate French or Swiss nursemaid. The police were convinced that she had some knowledge of the crime. They refused to believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of despair the poor girl threw herself from a window and was killed. It was proved afterwards that she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in the crime.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is not good to think of,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“About six months later, this man Cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who had kidnapped the child. They had used the same methods in the past. If the police seemed likely to get on their trail, they killed their prisoner, hid the body, and continued to extract as much money as possible before the crime was discovered.</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">“Now, I will make clear to you this, my friend. Cassetti was the man! But by means of the enormous wealth he had piled up, and owing to the secret hold he had over various persons, he was acquitted on some technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding that, he would have been lynched by the populace had he not been clever enough to give them the slip. It is now clear to me what</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">happened. He changed his name and left America. Since then he has been a gentleman of leisure, travelling abroad and living on his <SPAN class="ft22">rentes</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Ah! quel animal</SPAN>!” M. Bouc’s tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret that he is <NOBR>dead—not</NOBR> at all!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I agree with you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Tout de même</SPAN>, it is not necessary that he should be killed on the Orient Express. There are other places.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot smiled a little. He realised that M. Bouc was biased in the matter.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“The question we have now to ask ourselves is this,” he said. “Is this murder the work of some rival gang whom Cassetti had <NOBR>double-crossed</NOBR> in the past, or is it an act of private vengeance?”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred fragment of paper.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“If I am right in my assumption, then, the letter was burnt by the murderer. Why? Because it mentioned the name ‘Armstrong,’ which is the clue to the mystery.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Are there any members of the Armstrong family living?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That, unfortunately, I do not know. I think I remember reading of a younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot went on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and Dr. Constantine. M. Bouc brightened at the mention of the broken watch.</P>
<P class="p204 ft5">“That seems to give us the time of the crime very exactly.” “Yes,” said Poirot. “It is very convenient.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">There was an indescribable something in his tone that made both the other two look at him curiously.</P>
<P class="p146 ft3">“You say that you yourself heard Ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minutes to one?” asked M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot related just what had occurred.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Well,” said M. Bouc, “that proves at least that <NOBR>Cassetti—or</NOBR> Ratchett, as I shall continue to call <NOBR>him—was</NOBR> certainly alive at twenty minutes to one.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5"><NOBR>“Twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one, to be precise.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">‘Then at twelve <NOBR>thirty-seven,</NOBR> to put it formally, Mr. Ratchett was alive. That is <SPAN class="ft22">one </SPAN>fact, at least.”</P>
<P class="p205 ft3">Poirot did not reply. He sat looking thoughtfully in front of him. There was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant entered. “The restaurant car is free now, Monsieur,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“We will go there,” said M. Bouc, rising.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I may accompany you?” asked Constantine.</P>
<P class="p206 ft5">“Certainly, my dear doctor. Unless M. Poirot has any objection?” “Not at all. Not at all,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">After a little politeness in the matter of <NOBR>precedence—“<SPAN class="ft22">Après</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> vous, </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">Monsieur</SPAN>”—“<SPAN class="ft22">Mais</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> non, après </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">vous</SPAN>”—they</NOBR> left the compartment.</P>

<P class="p4 ft5">“Excellent,” said Poirot. “We can open our Court of Inquiry without more ado. First, I think, we should take the evidence of the Wagon Lit conductor. You probably know something about the man. What character has he? Is he a man on whose word you would place reliance?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I should say so, most assuredly. Pierre Michel has been employed by the company for over fifteen years. He is a <NOBR>Frenchman—lives</NOBR> near Calais. Thoroughly respectable and honest. Not, perhaps, remarkable for brains.”</P>

<P class="p210 ft3">Pierre Michel had recovered some of his assurance, but he was still extremely nervous.</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">“I hope Monsieur will not think that there has been any negligence on my part,” he said anxiously, his eyes going from Poirot to M. Bouc. “It is a terrible thing that has happened. I hope Monsieur does not think that it reflects on me in any way?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Having soothed the man’s fears, Poirot began his questions. He first elicited Michel’s name and address, his length of service, and the length of time he had been on this particular route. These particulars he already knew, but the routine questions served to put the man at his ease.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And now,” went on Poirot, “let us come to the events of Last night. M. Ratchett retired to <NOBR>bed—when?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Almost immediately after dinner, Monsieur. Actually before we left Belgrade. So he did on the previous night. He had directed me to make up the bed while he was at dinner, and I did so.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did anybody go into his compartment afterwards?”</P>
<P class="p211 ft5">“His valet, Monsieur, and the young American gentleman, his secretary.” “Anyone else?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, Monsieur, not that I know of.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">“Good. And that is the last you saw or heard of him?”</P>
<P class="p96 ft3">“No, Monsieur. You forget he rang his bell about twenty to <NOBR>one—soon</NOBR> after we had stopped.” “What happened exactly?”</P>
<P class="p212 ft5">“I knocked at the door, but he called out and said he had made a mistake.” “In English or in French?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“In French.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What were his words exactly?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Ce n’est rien. Je me suis trompé<SPAN class="ft3">.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p213 ft5">“Quite right,” said Poirot. “That is what I heard. And then you went away?” “Yes, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did you go back to your seat?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“No, Monsieur, I went first to answer another bell that had just rung.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Now, Michel, I am going to ask you an important question. Where were you at a quarter past one?’</P>
<P class="p214 ft3">“I, Monsieur? I was at my little seat at the <NOBR>end—facing</NOBR> up the corridor.” “You are sure?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Mais </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">oui</SPAN>—at</NOBR> <NOBR>least—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I went into the next coach, the Athens coach, to speak to my colleague there. We spoke about the snow. That was at some time soon after one o’clock. I cannot say exactly.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And you <NOBR>returned—when?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“One of my bells rang, <NOBR>Monsieur—I</NOBR> <NOBR>remember—I</NOBR> told you. It was the American lady. She had rung several times.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I recollect,” said Poirot. “And after that?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“After that, Monsieur? I answered your bell and brought you some mineral water. Then, about half an hour later, I made up the bed in one of the other <NOBR>compartments—that</NOBR> of the young American gentleman, Mr. Ratchett’s secretary.”</P>
<P class="p193 ft3">“Was Mr. MacQueen alone in his compartment when you went to make up his bed?” “The English Colonel from No. 15 was with him. They had been sitting talking.” “What did the Colonel do when he left Mr. MacQueen?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“He went back to his own compartment.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No. <NOBR>15—that</NOBR> is quite close to your seat, is it not?”</P>
<P class="p215 ft5">“Yes, Monsieur, it is the second compartment from that end of the corridor.” “His bed was already made up?”</P>
<P class="p102 ft5">“Yes, Monsieur. I had made it up while he was at dinner.” “What time was all this?”</P>
<P class="p216 ft3">“I could not say exactly, Monsieur. Not later than two o’clock certainly.” “And after that?”</P>
<P class="p217 ft5">“After that, Monsieur, I sat in my seat till morning.” “You did not go again into the Athens coach?” “No, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Perhaps you slept?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I do not think so, Monsieur. The train being at a standstill prevented me from dozing off as I usually do.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Did you see any of the passengers moving up or down the corridor?”</P>
<P class="p218 ft3">The man reflected. “One of the ladies went to the toilet at the far end, I think.” “Which lady?”</P>

<P class="p219 ft3">“I do not know, Monsieur. It was far down the corridor and she had her back to me. She had on a kimono of scarlet with dragons on it.”</P>
<P class="p220 ft5">Poirot nodded. “And after that?” “Nothing, Monsieur, until the morning.” “You are sure?”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Ah, <NOBR>pardon—you</NOBR> yourself, Monsieur, opened your door and looked out for a second.” “Good, my friend,” said Poirot. “I wondered whether you would remember that. By the way, I</P>
<P class="p221 ft3">was awakened by what sounded like something heavy falling against my door. Have you any idea what that could have been?”</P>
<P class="p222 ft5">The man stared at him. “There was nothing, Monsieur. Nothing, I am positive of it.” “Then I must have had the <SPAN class="ft4">cauchemar</SPAN>,” said Poirot philosophically.</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Unless,” put in M. Bouc, “it was something in the compartment next door that you heard.” Poirot took no notice of the suggestion. Perhaps he did not wish to before the Wagon Lit</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">conductor.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Let us pass to another point,” he said. “Supposing that last night an assassin joined the train. Is it quite certain that he could not have left it after committing the crime?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Pierre Michel shook his head.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Nor that he can be concealed on it somewhere?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“It has been well searched,” said M. Bouc. “Abandon that idea, my friend.”</P>
<P class="p223 ft5">“Besides,” said Michel, “no one could get on to the <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> without my seeing them.” “When was the last stop?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Vincovci.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What time was that?”</P>
<P class="p224 ft5">“We should have left there at 11:58, but owing to the weather we were twenty minutes late.” “Someone might have come along from the ordinary part of the train?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“No, Monsieur. After the service of dinner, the door between the ordinary carriages and the <NOBR>sleeping-cars</NOBR> is locked.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did you yourself descend from the train at Vincovci?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Yes, Monsieur. I got down onto the platform as usual and stood by the step up into the train. The other conductors did the same.”</P>
<P class="p225 ft3">“What about the forward <NOBR>door—the</NOBR> one near the restaurant car?” “It is always fastened on the inside.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is not so fastened now.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The man looked surprised; then his face cleared. “Doubtless one of the passengers opened it to look out on the snow.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Probably,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p226 ft5">He tapped thoughtfully on the table for a minute or two. “Monsieur does not blame me?” said the man timidly. Poirot smiled on him kindly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You have had the evil chance, my friend,” he said. “Ah! one other point while I remember it. You said that another bell rang just as you were knocking at M. Ratchett’s door. In fact I heard it myself Whose was it?”</P>
<P class="p181 ft3">“It was the bell of Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff. She desired me to summon her maid.” “And you did so?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot studied the plan in front of him thoughtfully. Then he inclined his head.</P>

<P class="p228 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE SECRETARY</P>
<P class="p202 ft3">For a minute or two Poirot remained lost, in thought.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I think,” he said at last, “that it would be well to have a further word with Mr. MacQueen, in view of what we now know.”</P>
<P class="p183 ft3">The young American appeared promptly. “Well,” he said, “how are things going?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Not too badly. Since our last conversation, I have learnt <NOBR>something—the</NOBR> identity of Mr. Ratchett.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Hector MacQueen leaned forward interestedly. “Yes?” he said.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN><SPAN class="ft26">‘Ratchett,’ as you suspected, was merely an alias. The man ‘Ratchett’ was Cassetti, who ran the celebrated kidnapping </SPAN><NOBR>stunts—including</NOBR> the famous affair of little Daisy Armstrong.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">An expression of utter astonishment appeared on MacQueen’s face. Then it darkened. “The damned skunk!” he exclaimed.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You had no idea of this, Mr. MacQueen?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“No, sir,” said the young American decidedly. “If I had, I’d have cut off my right hand before it had a chance to do secretarial work for him!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You feel strongly about the matter, Mr. MacQueen?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I have a particular reason for doing so. My father was the district attorney who handled the case, Mr. Poirot. I saw Mrs. Armstrong more than <NOBR>once—she</NOBR> was a lovely woman. So gentle and heartbroken.” His face darkened. “If ever a man deserved what he got, <NOBR>Ratchett—or</NOBR> <NOBR>Cassetti—is</NOBR> the man. I’m rejoiced at his end. Such a man wasn’t fit to live!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You almost feel as though you would have been willing to do the good deed yourself?”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“I do. <NOBR>I—”</NOBR> He paused, then added rather guiltily, “Seems I’m kind of incriminating myself.” “I should be more inclined to suspect you, Mr. MacQueen, if you displayed an inordinate</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">sorrow at your employer’s decease.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I don’t think I could do that even to save myself from the chair,” said MacQueen grimly. Then he added: “If I’m not being unduly curious, just how did you figure this out? Cassetti’s identity, I mean.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“By a fragment of a letter found in his compartment.”</P>
<P class="p229 ft3">“But <NOBR>surely—I</NOBR> <NOBR>mean—that</NOBR> was rather careless of the old man?” “That depends,” said Poirot, “on the point of view.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">The young man seemed to find this remark rather baffling. He stared at Poirot as though trying to make him out.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“The task before me,” said Poirot, “is to make sure of the movements of every one on the train. No offence need be taken, you understand. It is only a matter of routine.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Sure. Get right on with it and let me clear my character if I can.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I need hardly ask you the number of your compartment,” said Poirot, smiling, “since I shared it with you for a night. It is the <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> compartment Nos. 6 and 7, and after my departure you had it to yourself.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That’s right.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">“Now, Mr. MacQueen, I want you to describe your movements last night from the time of leaving the <NOBR>dining-car.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That’s quite easy. I went back to my compartment, read a bit, got out on the platform at Belgrade, decided it was too cold, and got in again. I talked for a while to a young English lady who is in the compartment next to mine. Then I fell into conversation with that Englishman, Colonel <NOBR>Arbuthnot—as</NOBR> a matter of fact I think you passed us as we were talking. Then I went in to Mr. Ratchett and, as I told you, took down some memoranda of letters he wanted written. I said good tight to him and left him. Colonel Arbuthnot was still standing in the corridor. His compartment was already made up for the night, so I suggested that he should come along to mine. I ordered a couple of drinks and we got right down to it. Discussed world politics and the Government of India and our own troubles with Prohibition and the Wall Street crisis. I don’t as a rule cotton to <NOBR>Britishers—they’re</NOBR> a <NOBR>stiff-necked</NOBR> <NOBR>lot—but</NOBR> I liked this one.”</P>
<P class="p230 ft3">“Do you know what time it was when he left you?” “Pretty late. Nearly two o’clock, I should say.” “You noticed that the train had stopped?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">‘Oh, yes. We wondered a bit. Looked out and saw the snow lying very thick, but we didn’t think it was serious.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What happened when Colonel Arbuthnot finally said good night?”</P>
<P class="p231 ft5">“He went along to his compartment and I called to the conductor to make up my bed.” “Where were you whilst he was making it?”</P>
<P class="p232 ft3">“Standing just outside the door in the corridor smoking a cigarette.” “And then?”</P>
<P class="p233 ft5">“And then I went to bed and slept till morning.” “During the evening did you leave the train at all?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Arbuthnot and I thought we’d get out <NOBR>at—what</NOBR> was the name of the <NOBR>place?—Vincovci—to</NOBR> stretch our legs a bit. But it was bitterly <NOBR>cold—a</NOBR> blizzard on. We soon hopped back again.”</P>
<P class="p234 ft3">“By which door did you leave the train?” “By the one nearest to our compartment.” “The one next to the <NOBR>dining-car?”</NOBR> “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p235 ft3">“Do you remember if it was bolted?” MacQueen considered.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Why, yes, I seem to remember it was. At least there was a kind of bar that fitted across the handle. Is that what you mean?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Yes. On getting back into the train did you replace that bar?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Why, <NOBR>no—I</NOBR> don’t think I did. I got in last. No, I don’t seem to remember doing so.” He added suddenly, “Is that an important point?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“It may be. Now, I presume, Monsieur, that while you and Colonel Arbuthnot were sitting talking the door of your compartment into the corridor was open?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Hector MacQueen nodded.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I want you, if you can, to tell me if anyone passed along that corridor <SPAN class="ft4">after </SPAN>the train left Vincovci up to the time you parted company for the night.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">MacQueen drew his brows together.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I think the conductor passed along once,” he said, “coming from the direction of the dining- car. And a woman passed the other way, going towards it.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Which woman?”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“I couldn’t say. I didn’t really notice. You see I was arguing a point with Arbuthnot. I just seem to remember a glimpse of some scarlet silk affair passing the door. I didn’t look, and anyway I wouldn’t have seen the person’s face. As you know, my carriage faces the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> end of the train, so a woman going along the corridor in that direction would have her back to me as soon as she’d passed.”</P>
<P class="p236 ft3">Poirot nodded. “She was going to the toilet, I presume?” “I suppose so.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And you saw her return?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, no, now that you mention it, I didn’t notice her returning but I suppose she must have done so.”</P>
<P class="p237 ft3">“One more question. Do you smoke a pipe, Mr. MacQueen?” “No, sir, I do not.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot paused a moment. “I think that is all at present. I should now like to see the valet of Mr. Ratchett. By the way, did both you and he always travel <NOBR>second-class?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“He did. But I usually went <NOBR>first—if</NOBR> possible in the compartment adjoining Mr. Ratchett’s. Then he had most of his baggage put in my compartment and yet could get at both it and me easily whenever he chose. But on this occasion all the <NOBR>first-class</NOBR> berths were booked except the one that he took.”</P>

<P class="p238 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE VALET</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">The American was succeeded by the pale Englishman with the inexpressive face whom Poirot had already noticed on the day before. He stood waiting very correctly. Poirot motioned to him to sit down.</P>
<P class="p239 ft3">“You are, I understand, the valet of M. Ratchett.” “Yes, sir.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Your name?”</P>
<P class="p240 ft3">“Edward Henry Masterman.” “Your age?” <NOBR>“Thirty-nine.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p241 ft3">“And your home address?” “21 Friar Street, Clerkenwell.”</P>
<P class="p67 ft3">“You have heard that your master has been murdered?” “Yes, sir. A very shocking occurrence.”</P>
<P class="p242 ft5">“Will you now tell me, please, at what hour you last saw M. Ratchett?” The valet considered.</P>
<P class="p243 ft3">“It must have been about nine o’clock, sir, last night. That or a little after.” “Tell me in your own words exactly what happened.”</P>
<P class="p244 ft5">“I went in to Mr. Ratchett as usual, sir, and attended to his wants.” “What were your duties exactly?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“To fold or hang up his clothes, sir, put his dental plate in water and see that he had everything he wanted for the night.”</P>
<P class="p245 ft3">“Was his manner much the same as usual?” The valet considered a moment.</P>
<P class="p246 ft5">“Well, sir, I think he was upset.” “In what <NOBR>way—upset?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Over a letter he’d been reading. He asked me if it was I who had put it in his compartment. Of course I told him I hadn’t done any such thing, but he swore at me and found fault with everything I did.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Was that unusual?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Oh, no, sir. He lost his temper <NOBR>easily—as</NOBR> I say, it just depended what had happened to upset him.”</P>
<P class="p247 ft23">“Did your master ever take a sleeping draught?” Dr. Constantine leaned forward a little.</P>
<P class="p248 ft5">“Always when travelling by train, sir. He said he couldn’t sleep otherwise.” “Do you know what drug he was in the habit of taking?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I couldn’t say, I’m sure, sir. There was no name on the <NOBR>bottle—just</NOBR> ‘<SPAN class="ft22">The Sleeping Draught to be taken at bedtime</SPAN>.’ ”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Did he take it last night?”</P>
<P class="p103 ft3">“Yes, sir. I poured it into a glass and put it on top of the toilet table ready for him.” “You didn’t actually see him drink it?”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">“No, sir.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What happened next?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I asked if there was anything further, and also asked what time he would like to be called in the morning. He said he didn’t want to be disturbed till he rang.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Was that usual?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Quite usual, sir. When he was ready to get up he used to ring the bell for the conductor and then send him for me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Was he usually an early or a late riser?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It depended, sir, on his mood. Sometimes he’d get up for breakfast, sometimes he wouldn’t get up till just on lunch time.”</P>
<P class="p249 ft3">“So that you weren’t alarmed when the morning wore on and no summons came?” “No, sir.”</P>
<P class="p250 ft5">“Did you know that your master had enemies?” “Yes, sir.” The man spoke quite unemotionally. “How did you know?”</P>
<P class="p251 ft3">“I had heard him discussing some letters, sir, with Mr. MacQueen.” “Had you an affection for your employer, Masterman?”</P>
<P class="p222 ft5">Masterman’s face became, if possible, even more inexpressive than it was normally. “I should hardly like to say that, sir. He was a generous employer.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But you didn’t like him?”</P>
<P class="p74 ft5">“Shall we put it that I don’t care very much for Americans, sir?” “Have you ever been in America?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, sir.”</P>
<P class="p215 ft5">“Do you remember reading in the paper of the Armstrong kidnapping case?” A little colour came into the man’s cheeks.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, indeed, sir. A little baby girl, wasn’t it? A very shocking affair.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Did you know that your employer, Mr. Ratchett, was the principal instigator in that affair?” “No, indeed, sir.” The valet’s tone held positive warmth and feeling for the first time. “I can</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">hardly believe it, sir.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Nevertheless, it is true. Now, to pass to your own movements last night. A matter of routine, you understand. What did you do after leaving your master?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I told Mr. MacQueen, sir, that the master wanted him. Then I went to my own compartment and read.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Your compartment <NOBR>was—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p252 ft5">“The end <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> one, sir. Next to the <NOBR>dining-car.”</NOBR> Poirot was looking at his plan.</P>
<P class="p253 ft3">“I <NOBR>see—and</NOBR> you had which berth?” “The lower one, sir.”</P>
<P class="p254 ft5">“That is No. 4?” “Yes, sir.”</P>
<P class="p255 ft5">“Is there anyone in with you?” “Yes, sir. A big Italian fellow.” “Does he speak English?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Well, a kind of English, sir.” The valet’s tone was deprecating. “He’s been in America— Chicago, I understand.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Do you and he talk together much?”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“No, sir. I prefer to read.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Poirot smiled. He could visualize the <NOBR>scene—the</NOBR> large, voluble Italian, and the snub direct administered by the gentleman’s gentleman.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And what, may I ask, are you reading?” he inquired.</P>
<P class="p192 ft5">“At present, sir, I am reading <SPAN class="ft4">Love’s Captive</SPAN>, by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.” “A good story?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I find it highly enjoyable, sir.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Well, let us continue. You returned to your compartment and read <SPAN class="ft22">Love’s Captive </SPAN>till— when?”</P>
<P class="p256 ft23">“At about ten thirty, sir, this Italian wanted to go to bed. So the conductor came and made the beds up.”</P>
<P class="p257 ft5">“And then you went to bed and to sleep?” “I went to bed, sir, but I didn’t sleep.” “Why didn’t you sleep?”</P>
<P class="p258 ft5">“I had the toothache, sir.” “Oh, <NOBR>là-là—that</NOBR> is painful.” “Most painful, sir.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Did you do anything for it?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I applied a little oil of cloves, sir, which relieved the pain a little, but I was still not able to get to sleep. I turned the light on above my head and continued to <NOBR>read—to</NOBR> take my mind off, as it were.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“And did you not go to sleep at all?”</P>
<P class="p233 ft3">“Yes, sir, I dropped off about four in the morning.” “And your companion?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“The Italian fellow? Oh, he just snored.”</P>
<P class="p259 ft5">“He did not leave the compartment at all during the night?” “No, sir.”</P>
<P class="p260 ft3">“Did you?” “No, sir.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Did you hear anything during the night?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I don’t think so, sir. Nothing unusual, I mean. The train being at a standstill made it all very quiet.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">Poirot was silent a moment or two. Then he spoke.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Well, I think there is very little more to be said. You cannot throw any light upon the tragedy?”</P>
<P class="p69 ft3">“I’m afraid not. I’m sorry, sir.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“As far as you know, was there any quarrel or bad blood between your master and Mr. MacQueen?”</P>
<P class="p76 ft5">“Oh! no, sir. Mr. MacQueen was a very pleasant gentleman.” “Where were you in service before you came to Mr. Ratchett?” “With Sir Henry Tomlinson, sir, in Grosvenor Square.” “Why did you leave him?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“He was going to East Africa, sir, and did not require my services any longer. But I am sure he will speak for me, sir. I was with him some years.”</P>
<P class="p261 ft3">“And you have been with Mr. <NOBR>Ratchett—how</NOBR> long?” “Just over nine months, sir.”</P>

<P class="p5 ft3">“Thank you, that will do.”</P>
<P class="p253 ft5">Poirot gave him a nod of dismissal. The valet hesitated a moment.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“You’ll excuse me, sir, but the elderly American lady is in what I might describe as a state, sir. She’s saying she knows all about the murderer. She’s in a very excitable condition, sir.”</P>

<P class="p159 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard arrived in the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> in such a state of breathless excitement that she was hardly able to articulate her words.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Now just tell me <NOBR>this—who’s</NOBR> in authority here? I’ve got some very important information, <SPAN class="ft4">very </SPAN>important indeed, and I’m going to tell it to someone in authority just as soon as I can. If you <NOBR>gentlemen—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p264 ft3">Her wavering glance fluctuated between the three men. Poirot leaned forward. “Tell it to me, Madame,” he said. “But first, pray be seated.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard plumped heavily down on to the seat opposite to him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“What I’ve got to tell you is just this. There was a murder on the train last night, and the murderer was <SPAN class="ft4">right there in my compartment</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p265 ft3">She paused to give dramatic emphasis to her words. “You are sure of this, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Of course I’m sure! The idea! I know what I’m talking about. I’ll tell you everything there is to tell. I’d gotten into bed and gone to sleep, and suddenly I woke <NOBR>up—everything</NOBR> was dark— and I knew there was a man in my compartment. I was just so scared I couldn’t scream, if you know what I mean. I just lay there and thought, ‘Mercy, I’m going to be killed!’ I just can’t describe to you how I felt. These nasty trains, I thought, and all the outrages I’d read of. And I thought, ‘Well, anyway, he won’t get my <NOBR>jewellery’—because,</NOBR> you see, I’d put that in a stocking and hidden it under my <NOBR>pillow—which</NOBR> isn’t any too comfortable, by the way; kinda bumpy, if you know what I mean. But that’s neither here nor there. Where was I?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You realised, Madame, that there was a man in your compartment.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes, well, I just lay there with my eyes closed, and wondered what I’d do. And I thought, well, I’m just thankful that my daughter doesn’t know the plight I’m in. And then, somehow, I got my wits about me and I felt about with my hand and I pressed the bell for the conductor. I pressed it and I pressed it, but nothing <NOBR>happened—and</NOBR> I can tell you, I thought my heart was going to stop beating. ‘Mercy,’ I said to myself, ‘maybe they’ve murdered every single soul on the train.’ It was at a standstill anyhow and there was a nasty quiet feel in the air. But I just went on pressing that bell and oh! the relief when I heard footsteps coming running down the corridor and a knock on the door! ‘Come in,’ I screamed, and I switched on the lights at the same time. And would you believe it, there wasn’t a <SPAN class="ft22">soul </SPAN>there!”</P>
<P class="p266 ft3">This seemed to Mrs. Hubbard to be a dramatic climax rather than an anticlimax. “And what happened next, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Why, I told the man what had happened and he didn’t seem to believe me. Seemed to imagine I’d dreamed the whole thing. I made him look under the seat, though he said there wasn’t room for a man to squeeze himself in there. It was plain enough that the man had got <NOBR>away—but</NOBR> there <SPAN class="ft4">had </SPAN>been a man there, and it just made me mad the way the conductor tried to soothe me down! I’m not one to imagine things, <NOBR>Mr.—I</NOBR> don’t think I know your name?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Poirot, Madame; and this is M. Bouc, a director of the company, and Dr. Constantine.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard murmured, “Pleased to meet you, I’m sure,” to all three of them in an abstracted manner and then plunged once more into her recital.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">“Now I’m just not going to pretend I was as bright as I might have been. I got it into my head that it was the man from next <NOBR>door—the</NOBR> poor fellow who’s been killed. I told the conductor to look at the door between the compartments, and sure enough it wasn’t bolted. Well, I soon saw to that. I told him to bolt it then and there, and after he’d gone out I got up and put a suitcase against it to make sure.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“What time was this, Mrs. Hubbard?”</P>
<P class="p267 ft3">“Well, I’m sure I can’t tell you. I never looked to see. I was so upset.” “And what is your theory now?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Why, I should say it was just as plain as plain could be. The man in my compartment was the murderer. Who else could he be?”</P>
<P class="p268 ft5">“And you think he went back into the adjoining compartment?” “How do I know where he went? I had my eyes tight shut.” “He might have slipped out through the door into the corridor.” “Well, I couldn’t say. You see, I had my eyes tight shut.” Mrs. Hubbard sighed convulsively.</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Mercy, I was scared! If my daughter only <NOBR>knew—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You do not think, Madame, that what you heard was the noise of someone moving about next <NOBR>door—in</NOBR> the murdered man’s compartment?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, I do not, <NOBR>Mr.—what</NOBR> is <NOBR>it?—Poirot.</NOBR> The man was <SPAN class="ft4">right there in the same compartment with me</SPAN>. And what’s more I’ve got proof of it.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">Triumphantly, she hauled a large handbag into view and proceeded to burrow in its interior. She took out in turn two large clean handkerchiefs, a pair of <NOBR>horn-rimmed</NOBR> glasses, a bottle of</P>
<P class="p106 ft3">aspirin, a packet of Glauber’s Salts, a celluloid tube of bright green peppermints, a bunch of keys, a pair of scissors, a book of American Express cheques, a snapshot of an extraordinarily <NOBR>plain-looking</NOBR> child, some letters, five strings of <NOBR>pseudo-Oriental</NOBR> beads, and a small metal <NOBR>object—a</NOBR> button.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“You see this button? Well, it’s not one of <SPAN class="ft22">my </SPAN>buttons. It’s not off anything I’ve got. I found it this morning when I got up.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">As she placed it on the table, M. Bouc. leaned forward and gave an exclamation. “But this is a button from the tunic of a Wagon Lit attendant!”</P>
<P class="p134 ft3">“There way be a natural explanation for that,” said Poirot. He turned gently to the lady.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“This button, Madame, may have dropped from the conductor’s uniform, either when he searched your cabin or when he was making the bed up last night.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I just don’t know what’s the matter with all you people. Seems as though you don’t want to do anything but make objections. Now listen here. I was reading a magazine last night before I went to sleep. Before I turned the light out, I placed that magazine on a little case that was standing on the floor near the window. Have you got that?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">They assured her that they had.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Very well then. The conductor looked under the seat from near the door, and then he came in and bolted the door between me and the next compartment, but he never went near the window. Well, this morning that button was lying right on top of the magazine. What do you call that, I should like to know?”</P>
<P class="p269 ft5">“That, Madame, I call evidence,” said Poirot. The answer seemed to appease the lady.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It makes me madder than a hornet to be disbelieved,” she explained.</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“You have given us most interesting and valuable evidence,” said Poirot soothingly. “Now may I ask you a few questions?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why, certainly.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“How was it, since you were nervous of this man Ratchett, that you hadn’t already bolted the door between the compartments?”</P>
<P class="p270 ft3">“I had,” returned Mrs. Hubbard promptly. “Oh, you had?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, as a matter of fact I asked that Swedish <NOBR>creature—a</NOBR> pleasant <NOBR>soul—if</NOBR> it was bolted, and she said it was.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“How was it you couldn’t see for yourself?”</P>
<P class="p271 ft5">“Because I was in bed and my spongebag was hanging on the <NOBR>door-handle.”</NOBR> “What time was it when you asked her to do this for you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now let me think. It must have- been round about <NOBR>half-past</NOBR> ten or a quarter to eleven. She’d come along to see if I had an aspirin. I told her where to find it and she got it out of my grip.”</P>
<P class="p272 ft5">“You yourself were in bed?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Suddenly she laughed. “Poor <NOBR>soul—she</NOBR> was so upset! You see, she’d opened the door of the next compartment by mistake.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Mr. Ratchett’s?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes. You know how difficult it is as you come along the train and all the doors are shut. She opened his by mistake. She was very distressed about it. He’d laughed, it seemed, and I guess he said something not quite nice. Poor thing, she certainly was upset. ‘Oh! I make mistake,’ she said. ‘I ashamed make mistake. Not nice man,’ she said. ‘He say, “You too old.” ’ ”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Dr. Constantine sniggered, and Mrs. Hubbard immediately froze him with a glance.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“He wasn’t a nice kind of man,” she said, “to say a thing like that to a lady. It’s not right to laugh at such things.” Dr. Constantine hastily apologised.</P>
<P class="p273 ft5">“Did you hear any noise from Mr. Ratchett’s compartment after that?” asked Poirot. <NOBR>“Well—not</NOBR> exactly.”</P>
<P class="p274 ft5">“What do you mean by that, Madame?” <NOBR>“Well—”</NOBR> She paused. “He snored.” <NOBR>“Ah!—he</NOBR> snored, did he?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Terribly. The night before, it kept me awake.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You didn’t hear him snore after you had had the scare about a man being in your compartment?”</P>
<P class="p275 ft3">“Why, Mr. Poirot, how could I? He was dead.” “Ah, Yes, truly,” said Poirot. He appeared confused.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Do you remember the affair of the Armstrong kidnap ping, Mrs. Hubbard?” he asked.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes, indeed I do. And how the wretch that did it escaped <NOBR>scot-free!</NOBR> My, I’d have liked to get my hands on him.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“He has not escaped. He is dead. He died last night.”</P>
<P class="p276 ft5">“You don’t <NOBR>mean—?’</NOBR> Mrs. Hubbard half rose from her chair in excitement. “But yes, I do. Ratchett was the man.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Well</SPAN>! Well, to think of that! I must write and tell my daughter. Now, didn’t I tell you last night that that man had an evil face? I was right, you see. My daughter always says: ‘When Mamma’s got a hunch you can bet your bottom dollar it’s O.K.’ ”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Were you acquainted with any of the Armstrong family, Mrs. Hubbard?”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">“No. They moved in a very exclusive circle. But I’ve always heard that Mrs. Armstrong was a perfectly lovely woman and that her husband worshipped her.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well, Mrs. Hubbard, you have helped us very <NOBR>much—very</NOBR> much indeed. Perhaps you will give me your full name?”</P>
<P class="p277 ft5">“Why, certainly. Caroline Martha Hubbard.” “Will you write your address down here?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard did so, without ceasing to speak. “I just can’t get over it. <NOBR>Cassetti—on</NOBR> this train. I had a hunch about that man, didn’t I, Mr. Poirot?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Yes, indeed, Madame. By the way, have you a scarlet silk <NOBR>dressing-gown?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Mercy, what a funny question! Why, no. I’ve got two <NOBR>dressing-gowns</NOBR> with <NOBR>me—a</NOBR> pink flannel one that’s kind of cosy for on board ship, and one my daughter gave me as a <NOBR>present—a</NOBR> kind of local affair in purple silk. But what in creation do you want to know about my dressing- gowns for?”</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“Well, you see, Madame, someone in a scarlet kimono entered either your or Mr. Ratchett’s compartment last night. It is, as you said just now, very difficult when all the doors are shut to know which compartment is which.”</P>
<P class="p278 ft3">“Well, no one in a scarlet <NOBR>dressing-gown</NOBR> came into my compartment.” “Then she must have gone into Mr. Ratchett’s.”</P>
<P class="p112 ft5">Mrs. Hubbard pursed her lips together and said grimly: “That wouldn’t surprise me any.” Poirot leaned forward. “So you heard a woman’s voice next door?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I don’t know how you guessed that, Mr. Poirot. I don’t really. <NOBR>But—well—as</NOBR> a matter of fact, I <SPAN class="ft4">did</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But when I asked you just now if you heard anything next door, you only said you heard Mr. Ratchett snoring.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, that was true enough. He <SPAN class="ft4">did </SPAN>snore part of the time. As for the <NOBR>other—”</NOBR> Mrs. Hubbard got rather embarrassed. “It isn’t a very nice thing to speak about.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What time was it when you heard a woman’s voice?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I can’t tell you. I just woke up for a minute and heard a woman talking, and it was plain enough where she was. So I just thought, ‘Well, <SPAN class="ft4">that’s </SPAN>the kind of man he is! I’m not <NOBR>surprised’—and</NOBR> then I went to sleep again. And I’m sure I should never have mentioned anything of the kind to three strange gentlemen if you hadn’t dragged it out of me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Was it before the scare about the man in your compartment, or after?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Why, that’s like what you said just now! He wouldn’t have had a woman talking to him if he were dead, would he?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Pardon</SPAN>. You must think me very stupid, Madame.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I guess even you get kinda muddled now and then. I just can’t get over its being that monster Cassetti. What my daughter will <NOBR>say—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot managed adroitly to help the good lady to replace the contents of her handbag, and he then shepherded her towards the door.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">At the last moment, he said:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame.”</P>
<P class="p172 ft5">Mrs. Hubbard looked at the little scrap of cambric he held out to her. “That’s not mine, Mr. Poirot. I’ve got mine right here.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Pardon</SPAN>. I thought as it had the initial H on <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p279 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE SWEDISH LADY</P>
<P class="p202 ft3">M. Bouc was handling the button that Mrs. Hubbard had left behind her.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“This button. I cannot understand it. Does it mean that after all, Pierre Michel is involved in some way?” he asked. He paused, then continued, as Poirot did not reply. “What have you to say, my friend?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That button, it suggests possibilities,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Let us interview next the Swedish lady before we discuss the evidence that we have heard.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He sorted through the pile of passports in front of him. “Ah! here we are. Greta Ohlsson, age <NOBR>forty-nine.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc gave directions to the restaurant attendant, and presently the lady with the yellowish grey bun of hair and the long, mild, <NOBR>sheep-like</NOBR> face was ushered in. She peered <NOBR>short-sightedly</NOBR> at Poirot through her glasses, but was quite calm.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It transpired that she understood and spoke French, so the conversation took place in that language. Poirot first asked her the questions to which he already knew the <NOBR>answers—her</NOBR> name, age, and address. He then asked her her occupation.</P>
<P class="p96 ft3">She was, she told him, matron in a missionary school near Stamboul. She was a trained nurse. “You know, of course, of what took place last night, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Naturally. It is very dreadful. And the American lady tells me that the murderer was actually in her compartment.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I hear, Mademoiselle, that you were the last person to see the murdered man alive?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I do not know. It may be so. I opened the door of his compartment by mistake. I was much ashamed. It was a most awkward mistake.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You actually saw him?”</P>
<P class="p280 ft5">“Yes. He was reading a book. I apologised quickly and withdrew.” “Did he say anything to you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">A slight flush showed on the worthy lady’s cheek.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“He laughed and said a few words. <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> did not quite catch them.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“And what did you do after that, Mademoiselle?” asked Poirot, passing from the subject tactfully.</P>
<P class="p146 ft3">“I went in to the American lady, Mrs. Hubbard. I asked her for some aspirin and she gave it to me.”</P>
<P class="p281 ft3">“Did she ask you whether the communicating door between her compartment and that of Mr. Ratchett was bolted?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p282 ft5">“And was it?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And after that?”</P>
<P class="p283 ft5">“After that I went back to my compartment, took the aspirin, and lay down.” “What time was all this?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“When I got into bed it was five minutes to eleven. I know because I looked at my watch before I wound it up.”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“Did you go to sleep quickly?”</P>
<P class="p284 ft3">“Not very quickly. My head got better, but I lay awake some time.” “Had the train come to a stop before you went to sleep?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not think so. We stopped, I think, at a station just as I was getting drowsy.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“That would be Vincovci. Now your compartment, Mademoiselle, is this one?” He indicated it on the plan.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is so, yes.”</P>
<P class="p285 ft5">“You had the upper or the lower berth?” “The lower berth, No. 10.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And you had a companion?’</P>
<P class="p286 ft5">“Yes, a young English lady. Very nice, very amiable. She had travelled from Baghdad.” “After the train left Vincovci, did she leave the compartment?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, I am sure she did not.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why are you sure if you were asleep?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I sleep very lightly. I am used to waking at a sound. I am sure that if she had come down from the berth above I should have awakened.”</P>
<P class="p245 ft3">“Did you yourself leave the compartment?” “Not until this morning.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Have you a scarlet silk kimono, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p287 ft5">“No, indeed. I have a good comfortable <NOBR>dressing-gown</NOBR> of Jaeger material.” “And the lady with you, Miss Debenham? What colour is her <NOBR>dressing-gown?’</NOBR> “A pale mauve aba such as you buy in the East.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot nodded. Then he asked in a friendly tone: “Why are you taking this journey? A holiday?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft23">“Yes, I am going home for a holiday. But first I am going to Lausanne to stay with a sister for a week or so.”</P>
<P class="p288 ft5">“Perhaps you will be so amiable as to write me down the name and address of your sister?’ “With pleasure.”</P>
<P class="p289 ft5">She took the paper and pencil he gave her and wrote down the name and address as requested. “Have you ever been in America, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No. I very nearly went once. I was to go with an invalid lady, but the plan was cancelled at the last moment. I much regretted this. They are very good, the Americans. They give much money to found schools and hospitals. And they are very practical.”</P>
<P class="p74 ft5">“Do you remember hearing of the Armstrong kidnapping case?” “No, what was that?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot explained.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Greta Ohlsson was indignant. Her yellow bun of hair quivered with her emotion.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“That there are in the world such evil men! It tries one’s faith. The poor <NOBR>mother—my</NOBR> heart aches for her.”</P>
<P class="p103 ft3">The amiable Swede departed, her kindly face flushed, her eyes suffused with tears. Poirot was writing busily on a sheet of paper.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“What is it you write there, my friend?” asked M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mon cher</SPAN>, it is my habit to be neat and orderly. I make here a little chronological table of events.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">He finished writing and passed the paper to M. Bouc.</P>

<P class="p5 ft3">“That is very clear,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“There is nothing there that strikes you as at all odd?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, it seems all quite clear and aboveboard. It seems quite plain that the crime was committed at 1.15. The evidence of the watch shows us that, and Mrs. Hubbard’s story fits in. For my mind, I will make a guess at the identity of the murderer. I say, my friend, that it is the big Italian. He comes from <NOBR>America—from</NOBR> <NOBR>Chicago—and</NOBR> remember an Italian’s weapon is the knife, and he stabs not once but several times.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“That is true.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Without a doubt, that is the solution of the mystery. Doubtless he and this Ratchett were in this kidnapping business together. Cassetti is an Italian name. In some way Ratchett did on him what they call the <NOBR>double-cross.</NOBR> The Italian tracks him down, sends him warning letters first, and finally revenges himself upon him in a brutal way. It is all quite simple.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">Poirot shook his head doubtfully.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is hardly so simple as that, I fear,” he murmured.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Me, I am convinced it is the truth,” said M. Bouc, becoming more and more enamoured of his theory.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And what about the valet with the toothache who swears that the Italian never left the compartment?”</P>
<P class="p292 ft5">“That is the difficulty.” Poirot twinkled.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Yes, it is annoying, that. Unlucky for your theory, and extremely lucky for our Italian friend that M. Ratchett’s valet should have had the toothache.”</P>
<P class="p229 ft3">“It will be explained,” said M. Bouc with magnificent certainty. Poirot shook his head again.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, it is hardly so simple as that,” he murmured again.</P>

<P class="p293 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE RUSSIAN PRINCESS</P>
<P class="p294 ft3">“Let us hear what Pierre Michel has to say about this button,” he said. The Wagon Lit conductor was recalled. He looked at them inquiringly. M. Bouc cleared his throat.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Michel,” he said, “here is a button from your tunic. It was found in the American lady’s compartment. What have you to say for yourself about it?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The conductor’s hand went automatically to his tunic. “I have lost no button, Monsieur,” he said. “There must be some mistake.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is very odd.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I cannot account for it, Monsieur.” The man seemed astonished, but not in any way guilty or confused.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc said meaningly: “Owing to the circumstances in which it was found, it seems fairly certain that this button was dropped by the man who was in Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment last night when she rang the bell.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But, Monsieur, there was no one there. The lady must have imagined it.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“She did not imagine it, Michel. The assassin of M. Ratchett passed that <NOBR>way—<SPAN class="ft22">and</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> dropped that button</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">As the significance of M. Bouc’s words became plain to him, Pierre Michel flew into a violent state of agitation.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is not true, Monsieur; it is not true!” he cried. “You are accusing me of the crime. Me, I am innocent. I am absolutely innocent! Why should I want to kill a Monsieur whom I have never seen before?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Where were you when Mrs. Hubbard’s bell rang?”</P>
<P class="p295 ft3">“I told you, Monsieur, in the next coach talking to my colleague.” “We will send for him.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Do so, Monsieur, I implore you, do so.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The conductor of the next coach was summoned. He immediately confirmed Pierre Michel’s statement. He added that the conductor from the Bucharest coach had also been there. The three of them had been discussing the situation caused by the snow. They had been talking some ten minutes when Michel fancied he heard a bell. As he opened the doors connecting the two coaches, they had all heard it <NOBR>plainly—a</NOBR> bell ringing repeatedly. Michel had run <NOBR>post-haste</NOBR> to answer it.</P>
<P class="p296 ft3">“So you see, Monsieur, I am not guilty,” cried Michel anxiously. “And this button from a Wagon Lit tunic, how do you explain it?” “I cannot, Monsieur. It is a mystery to me. All my buttons are intact.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Both of the other conductors also declared that they had not lost a button; also that they had not been inside Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment at any time.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Calm yourself, Michel,” said M. Bouc, “and cast your mind back to the moment when you ran to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s bell. Did you meet anyone at all in the corridor?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did you see anyone going away from you down the corridor in the other direction?”</P>

<P class="p297 ft3">“Again, no, Monsieur.” “Odd,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Not so very,” said Poirot. “It is a question of time. Mrs. Hubbard wakes to find someone in her compartment. For a minute or two she lies paralysed, her eyes shut. Probably it was then that the man slipped out into the corridor. Then she starts ringing the bell. But the conductor does not come at once. It is only the third or fourth peal that he hears. I should say myself that there was ample <NOBR>time—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p298 ft23">“For what? For what, <SPAN class="ft24">mon cher</SPAN>! Remember, there are thick drifts of snow all round the train.” “There are two courses open to our mysterious assassin,” said Poirot slowly. “He could retreat</P>
<P class="p299 ft5">into either of the toilets <NOBR>or—he</NOBR> could disappear into one of the compartments.” “But they were all occupied.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p97 ft5">“You mean that he could retreat into his <SPAN class="ft4">own </SPAN>compartment?” Poirot nodded.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It <NOBR>fits—it</NOBR> fits;’ murmured M. Bouc. “During that ten minutes’ absence of the conductor, the murderer comes from his own compartment, goes into Ratchett’s, kills him, locks and chains the door on the inside, goes out through Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment, and is back safely in his own compartment by the time the conductor arrives.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot murmured: “It is not quite so simple as that, my friend. Our friend the doctor here will tell you so.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">With a gesture M. Bouc signified that the three conductors might depart.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“We have still to see eight passengers,” said Poirot. “Five <NOBR>first-class</NOBR> <NOBR>passengers—Princess</NOBR> Dragomiroff, Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, and Mr. Hardman. Three <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> <NOBR>passengers—Miss</NOBR> Debenham, Antonio Foscarelli, and the <NOBR>lady’s-maid,</NOBR> Fräulein Schmidt.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Whom will you see <NOBR>first—the</NOBR> Italian?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“How you harp on your Italian! No, we will start at the top of the tree. Perhaps Madame la Princesse will be so good as to spare us a few moments of her time. Convey that message to her, Michel.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Oui, Monsieur</SPAN>,” said the conductor, who was just leaving the car.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Tell her we can wait on her in her compartment if she does not wish to put herself to the trouble of coming here,” called M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">But Princess Dragomiroff declined to take this course. She appeared in the <NOBR>dining-car,</NOBR> inclined her head slightly and sat down opposite Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Her small <NOBR>toad-like</NOBR> face looked even yellower than the day before. She was certainly ugly, and yet, like the toad, she had eyes like jewels, dark and imperious, revealing latent energy and an intellectual force that could be felt at once.</P>
<P class="p284 ft3">Her voice was deep, very distinct, with a slight grating quality in it. She cut short a flowery phrase of apology from M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“You need not offer apologies, Messieurs. I understand a murder has taken place. Naturally you must interview all the passengers. I shall be glad to give you all the assistance in my power.”</P>
<P class="p300 ft3">“You are most amiable, Madame,” said Poirot. “Not at all. It is a duty. What do you wish to know?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Your full Christian names and address, Madame. Perhaps you would prefer to write them yourself?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot proffered a sheet of paper and pencil, but the Princess waved them aside.</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“You can write it,” she said. “There is nothing difficult. Natalia Dragomiroff, 17 Avenue Kléber, Paris.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are travelling home from Constantinople, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes. I have been staying at the Austrian Embassy. My maid is with me.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Would you be so good as to give me a brief account of your movements last night from dinner onwards?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Willingly. I directed the conductor to make up my bed whilst I was in the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> I retired to bed immediately after dinner. I read until the hour of eleven, when I turned out my light. I was unable to sleep owing to certain rheumatic pains from which I suffer. At about a quarter to one I rang for my maid. She massaged me and then read aloud till I felt sleepy. I cannot say exactly, when she left me. It may have been half an hour afterward, it may have been later.”</P>
<P class="p301 ft3">“The train had stopped then?” “The train had stopped.”</P>
<P class="p244 ft3">“You heard <NOBR>nothing—nothing</NOBR> unusual during the time, Madame?” “I heard nothing unusual.”</P>
<P class="p302 ft5">“What is your maids name?” “Hildegarde Schmidt.”</P>
<P class="p303 ft5">“She has been with you long?” “Fifteen years.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You consider her trustworthy?”</P>
<P class="p304 ft3">“Absolutely. Her people come from an estate of my late husband’s in Germany.” “You have been in America, I presume, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The abrupt change of subject made the old lady raise her eyebrows. “Many times.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Were you at any time acquainted with a family of the name of <NOBR>Armstrong—a</NOBR> family in which a tragedy occurred?”</P>
<P class="p128 ft3">With some emotion in her voice the old lady said: “You speak of friends of mine, Monsieur.” “You knew Colonel Armstrong well, then?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I knew him slightly, but his wife, Sonia Armstrong, was my <NOBR>god-daughter.</NOBR> I was on terms of friendship with her mother, the actress, Linda Arden. Linda Arden was a great genius, one of the greatest tragic actresses in the world. As Lady Macbeth, as Magda, there was no one to touch her. I was not only an admirer of her art, I was a personal friend.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“She is dead?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, no, she is alive, but she lives in complete retirement. Her health is very delicate, and she has to lie on a sofa most of the time.”</P>
<P class="p305 ft3">“There was, I think, a second daughter?” “Yes, much younger than Mrs. Armstrong.” “And she is alive?”</P>
<P class="p306 ft5">“Certainly.” “Where is she?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The old woman bent an acute glance at him.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I must ask you the reason for these questions. What have they to do with the matter in <NOBR>hand—the</NOBR> murder on this train?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“They are connected in this way, Madame: the man who was murdered was the man responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Mrs. Armstrong’s child.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Ah!”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">The straight brows came together. Princess Dragomiroff drew herself a little more erect.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“In my view, then, this murder is an entirely admirable happening! You will pardon my slightly biased point of view.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is most natural, Madame. And now to return to the question you did not answer. Where is the younger daughter of Linda Arden, the sister of Mrs. Armstrong?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur. I have lost touch with the younger generation. I believe she married an Englishman some years ago and went to England, but at the moment I cannot recollect the name.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">She paused a minute and then said:</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Is there anything further you want to ask me, gentlemen?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Only one thing, Madame, a somewhat personal question. The colour of your dressing- gown.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">She raised her eyebrows slightly. “I must suppose you have a reason for such a question. My <NOBR>dressing-gown</NOBR> is of black satin.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“There is nothing more, Madame. I am much obliged to you for answering my questions so promptly.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She made a slight gesture with her heavily beringed hand. Then as she rose, and the others rose with her, she stopped.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You will excuse me, Monsieur,” she said, “but may I ask your name? Your face is somehow familiar to me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“My name, Madame, is Hercule <NOBR>Poirot—at</NOBR> your service.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She was silent a minute, then: “Hercule Poirot,” she said. “Yes. I remember now. This is Destiny.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">She walked away, very erect, a little stiff in her movements.</P>
<P class="p307 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Voilà une grande dame</SPAN>,” said M. Bouc. “What do you think of her, my friend?” But Hercule Poirot merely shook his head.</P>

<P class="p308 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF COUNT AND COUNTESS ANDRENYI</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">Count and Countess Andrenyi were next summoned. The Count, however, entered the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> alone.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">There was no doubt that he was a <NOBR>fine-looking</NOBR> man seen face to face. He was at least six feet in height, with broad shoulders and slender hips. He was dressed in very <NOBR>well-cut</NOBR> English tweeds and might have been taken for an Englishman had it not been for the length of his moustache and something in the line of the cheekbone.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Well, Messieurs,” he said, “what can I do for you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You understand, Monsieur,” said Poirot, “that in view of what has occurred I am obliged to put certain questions to all the passengers.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Perfectly, perfectly,” said the Count easily. “I quite understand your position. Not, I fear, that my wife and I can do much to assist you. We were asleep and heard nothing at all.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Are you aware of the identity of the deceased, Monsieur?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I understood it was the big <NOBR>American—a</NOBR> man with a decidedly unpleasant face. He sat at that table at meal times.” He indicated with a nod of his head the table at which Ratchett and MacQueen had sat.</P>
<P class="p309 ft3">“Yes, yes, Monsieur, you are perfectly correct. I <NOBR>meant—did</NOBR> you know the name of the man?” “No.” The Count looked thoroughly puzzled by Poirot’s queries.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“If you want to know his name,” he said, “surely it is on his passport?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The name on his passport is Ratchett,” said Poirot. “But that, Monsieur, is not his real name. He is the man Cassetti, who was responsible for a celebrated kidnapping outrage in America.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He watched the Count closely as he spoke, but the latter seemed quite unaffected by this piece of news. He merely opened his eyes a little.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah!” he said. “That certainly should throw light upon the matter. An extraordinary country, America.”</P>
<P class="p310 ft5">“You have been there, perhaps, Monsieur le Comte?” “I was in Washington for a year.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You knew, perhaps, the Armstrong family?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“Armstrong—Armstrong—it</NOBR> is difficult to recall. One met so many.” He smiled, shrugged his shoulders. “But to come back to the matter in hand, gentlemen,” he said. “What more can I do to assist you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You retired to <NOBR>rest—when,</NOBR> Monsieur le Comte?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Hercule Poirot’s eyes stole to his plan. Count and Countess Andrenyi occupied compartment Nos. 12 and 13 adjoining.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“We had one compartment made up for the night whilst we were in the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> On returning we sat in the other for a <NOBR>while—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Which number would that be?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No. 13. We played piquet together. At about eleven o’clock my wife retired for the night. The conductor made up my compartment and I also went to bed. I slept soundly until morning.”</P>
<P class="p311 ft3">“Did you notice the stopping of the train?” “I was not aware of it till this morning.”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“And your wife?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The Count smiled. “My wife always takes a sleeping draught when travelling by train. She took her usual dose of trional.”</P>
<P class="p76 ft5">He paused. “I am sorry I am not able to assist you in any way.” Poirot passed him a sheet of paper and a pen.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Thank you, Monsieur le Comte. It is a formality, but will you just let me have your name and address?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The Count wrote slowly and carefully.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is just as well that I should write this for you,” he said pleasantly. “The spelling of my country estate is a little difficult for those unacquainted with the language.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He passed the paper across to Poirot and rose.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It will be quite unnecessary for my wife to come here,” he said. “She can tell you nothing more than I have.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">A little gleam came into Poirot’s eye.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Doubtless, doubtless,” he said. “But all the same I think I should like to have just one little word with Madame la Comtesse.”</P>
<P class="p312 ft3">“I assure you it is quite unnecessary.” The Count’s voice rang out authoritatively. Poirot blinked gently at him.</P>
<P class="p313 ft5">“It will be a mere formality,” he said. “But, you understand, it is necessary for my report.” “As you please.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The Count gave way grudgingly. He made a short foreign bow and left the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot reached out a hand to a passport. It set out the Count’s names and titles. He passed on to the further information. “<SPAN class="ft22">Accompanied by</SPAN>, wife; <SPAN class="ft22">Christian name</SPAN>, Elena Maria; <SPAN class="ft22">maiden name</SPAN>, Goldenberg; <SPAN class="ft22">age</SPAN>, twenty.” A spot of grease had been dropped on it at some time by a careless official.</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“A diplomatic passport,” said M. Bouc. “We must be careful, my friend, to give no offence. These people can have nothing to do with the murder.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Be easy, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>, I will be most tactful. A mere formality.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">His voice dropped as the Countess Andrenyi entered the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> She looked timid and extremely charming.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You wish to see me, Messieurs?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“A mere formality, Madam la Comtesse.” Poirot rose gallantly, bowed her into the seat opposite him. “It is only to ask you if you saw or heard anything last night that may throw light upon this matter.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“Nothing at all, Monsieur. I was asleep.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You did not hear, for instance, a commotion going on in the compartment next to yours? The American lady who occupies it had quite an attack of hysterics and rang for the conductor.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I heard nothing, Monsieur. You see, I had taken a sleeping draught.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! I comprehend. Well, I need not detain you further.” Then, as she rose <NOBR>swiftly—“Just</NOBR> one little minute. These <NOBR>particulars—your</NOBR> maiden name, age and so <NOBR>on—they</NOBR> are correct?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Quite correct, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Perhaps you will sign this memorandum to that effect, then.”</P>
<P class="p314 ft5">She signed quickly, in a graceful slanting <NOBR>hand-writing—<SPAN class="ft4">Elena</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> Andrenyi</SPAN>. “Did you accompany your husband to America, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“No, Monsieur.” She smiled, flushed a little. “We were not married then; we have been married only a year.”</P>

<P class="p315 ft3">“Ah, yes, thank you, Madame. By the way, does your husband smoke?” She stared at him as she stood poised for departure.</P>
<P class="p316 ft3">“Yes.” “A pipe?”</P>
<P class="p317 ft5">“No. Cigarettes and cigars.” “Ah! Thank you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She lingered, her eyes watching him curiously. Lovely eyes they were, dark and almond- shaped with very long black lashes that swept the exquisite pallor of her cheeks. Her lips, very scarlet in the foreign fashion, were parted just a little. She looked exotic and beautiful.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why did you ask me that?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Madame,” Poirot waved an airy hand, “detectives have to ask all sorts of questions. For instance, perhaps you will tell me the colour of your <NOBR>dressing-gown?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p288 ft5">She stared at him. Then she laughed. “it is <NOBR>corn-coloured</NOBR> chiffon. Is that really important?” “Very important, Madame.”</P>
<P class="p226 ft3">She asked curiously: “Are you really a detective, then?” “At your service, Madame.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I thought there were no detectives on the train when it passed through <NOBR>Jugo-Slavia—not</NOBR> until one got to Italy.”</P>
<P class="p318 ft5">“I am not a <NOBR>Jugo-Slavian</NOBR> detective, Madame. I am an international detective.” “You belong to the League of Nations?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I belong to the world, Madame,” said Poirot dramatically. He went on: “I work mainly in London. You speak English?” he added in that language.</P>
<P class="p319 ft5">“I speak a leetle, yes.” Her accent was charming. Poirot bowed once more. “We will not detain you further, Madame. You see, it was not so very terrible.” She smiled, inclined her head and departed.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Elle est jolie femme</SPAN>,” said M. Bouc appreciatively. He sighed. “Well, that did not advance us much.”</P>
<P class="p187 ft5">“No,” said Poirot. “Two people who saw nothing and heard nothing.” “Shall we now see the Italian?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Poirot did not reply for a moment. He was studying a grease spot on a Hungarian diplomatic passport.</P>

<P class="p320 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF COLONEL ARBUTHNOT</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">Poirot roused himself with a slight start. His eyes twinkled a little as they met the eager ones of M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! my dear old friend,” he said, “you see I have become what they call the snob! The first class, I feel it should be attended to before the second class. Next, I think, we will interview the <NOBR>good-looking</NOBR> Colonel Arbuthnot.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Finding the Colonel’s French to be of a severely limited description, Poirot conducted his interrogatory in English.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Arbuthnot’s name, age, home address and exact military standing were all ascertained. Poirot proceeded:</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is that you come home from India on what is called the <NOBR>leave—what</NOBR> we can call <SPAN class="ft22">en permission</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft23">Colonel Arbuthnot, uninterested in what a pack of foreigners called anything, replied with true British brevity, “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p321 ft5">“But you do not come home on the P. & O. boat?” “No.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why not?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I chose to come by the overland route for reasons of my own.”</P>
<P class="p322 ft5">(“And that,” his manner seemed to say, “is one for you, you interfering little jackanapes.”) “You came straight through from India?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The Colonel replied drily: “I stopped for one night to see Ur of the Chaldees, and for three days in Baghdad with the A.O.C., who happens to be an old friend of mine.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You stopped three days in Baghdad. I understand that the young English lady, Miss Debenham, also comes from Baghdad. Perhaps you met her there?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, I did not. I first met Miss Debenham when she and I shared the railway convoy car from Kirkuk to Nissibin.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot leaned forward. He became persuasive and a little more foreign than he need have been.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“Monsieur, I am about to appeal to you. You and Miss Debenham are the only two English people on the train. It is necessary that I should ask you each your opinion of the other.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Highly irregular,” said Colonel Arbuthnot coldly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Not so. You see, this crime, it was most probably committed by a woman. The man was stabbed no fewer than twelve times. Even the <SPAN class="ft4">chef de train </SPAN>said at once, ‘It is a woman.’ Well, then, what is my first task? To give all the women travelling on the <NOBR>Istanbul-Calais</NOBR> coach what Americans call the <NOBR>‘once-over.’</NOBR> But to judge of an Englishwoman is difficult. They are very reserved, the English. So I appeal to you, Monsieur, in the interest of justice. What sort of person is this Miss Debenham? What do you know about her?”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Miss Debenham,” said the Colonel with some warmth, “is a lady.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Ah!” said Poirot with every appearance of being much gratified. “So you do not think that she is likely to be implicated in this crime?”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“The idea is absurd,” said Arbuthnot. “The man was a perfect <NOBR>stranger—she</NOBR> had never seen him before.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did she tell you so?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“She did. She commented at once upon his somewhat unpleasant appearance. If a woman is concerned, as you seem to think (to my mind without any evidence but on a mere assumption), I can assure you that Miss Debenham could not possibly be implicated.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You feel warmly in the matter,” said Poirot with a smile.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Colonel Arbuthnot gave him a cold stare. “I really don’t know what you mean,” he said.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The stare seemed to abash Poirot. He dropped his eyes and began fiddling with the papers in front of him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“All this is by the way,” he said. “Let us be practical and come to facts. This crime, we have reason to believe, took place at a quarter past one last night. It is part of the necessary routine to ask everyone on the train what he or she was doing at that time.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Quite so. At a quarter past one, to the best of my belief, I was talking to the young American <NOBR>fellow—secretary</NOBR> to the dead man.”</P>
<P class="p323 ft5">“Ah! were you in his compartment, or was he in yours?” “I was in his.”</P>
<P class="p324 ft3">“That is the young man of the name of MacQueen?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“He was a friend or acquaintance of yours?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, I never saw him before this journey. We fell into casual conversation yesterday and both became interested. I don’t as a rule like <NOBR>Americans—haven’t</NOBR> any use for <NOBR>’em—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot smiled, remembering MacQueen’s strictures on “Britishers.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3"><NOBR>“—but</NOBR> I liked this young fellow. He’d got hold of some tomfool idiotic ideas about the situation in India. That’s the worst of <NOBR>Americans—they’re</NOBR> so sentimental and idealistic. Well, he was interested in what I had to tell him. I’ve had nearly thirty years’ experience of the country. And I was interested in what he had to tell me about the working of Prohibition in America. Then we got down to world politics in general. I was quite surprised to look at my watch and find it was a quarter to two.”</P>
<P class="p325 ft3">“That is the time you broke up this conversation?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What did you do then?”</P>
<P class="p326 ft5">“Walked along to my own compartment and turned in.” “Your bed was made up ready?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“That is the <NOBR>compartment—let</NOBR> me <NOBR>see—No.</NOBR> <NOBR>15—the</NOBR> one next but one to the end away from the <NOBR>dining-car?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Where was the conductor when you went to your compartment?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Sitting at the end at a little table. As a matter of fact MacQueen called him just as I went in to my own compartment.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why did he call him?”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“To make up his bed, I suppose. The compartment hadn’t been made up for the night.” “Now, Colonel Arbuthnot, I want you to think carefully. During the time you were talking to</P>
<P class="p327 ft3">Mr. MacQueen, did anyone pass along the corridor outside the door?” “A good many people, I should think. I wasn’t paying attention.”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“Ah! but I am referring <NOBR>to—let</NOBR> us say, the last hour and a half of your conversation. You got out at Vincovci, didn’t you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes, but only for about a minute. There was a blizzard on. The cold was something frightful. Made one quite thankful to get back to the fug, though as a rule I think the way these trains are overheated is something scandalous.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc sighed. “It is very difficult to please everybody,” he said. “The English they open <NOBR>everything—then</NOBR> others they come along and shut everything. It is very difficult.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Neither Poirot nor Colonel Arbuthnot paid any attention to him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now, Monsieur, cast your mind back,” said Poirot encouragingly. “It was cold outside. You have returned to the train. You sit down again, you <NOBR>smoke—perhaps</NOBR> a <NOBR>cigarette—perhaps</NOBR> a <NOBR>pipe—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p72 ft3">He paused for the fraction of a second.</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“A pipe for me. MacQueen smoked cigarettes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The train starts again. You smoke your pipe. You discuss the state of <NOBR>Europe—of</NOBR> the world. It is late now. Most people have retired for the night. Does anyone pass the door? Think.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot frowned in the effort of remembrance.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Difficult to say,” he said. “You see I wasn’t paying any attention.”</P>
<P class="p328 ft5">“But you have the soldier’s observation for detail. You notice without noticing, so to speak.” The Colonel thought again, but shook his head.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I couldn’t say. I don’t remember anyone passing except the conductor. Wait a <NOBR>minute—and</NOBR> there was a woman, I think.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You saw her? Was she <NOBR>old—young?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p329 ft5">“Didn’t see her. Wasn’t looking that way. just a rustle and a sort of smell of scent.” “Scent? A <SPAN class="ft4">good </SPAN>scent?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, rather fruity, if you know what I mean. I mean you’d smell it a hundred yards away. But mind you,” the Colonel went on hastily, “this may have been earlier in the evening. You see, as you said just now, it was just one of those things you notice without noticing, so to speak. Some time that evening I said to <NOBR>myself—‘Woman—scent—got</NOBR> it on pretty thick.’ But <SPAN class="ft4">when </SPAN>it was I can’t be sure, except <NOBR>that—why,</NOBR> yes, it must have been after Vincovci.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Because I <NOBR>remember—sniffing,</NOBR> you <NOBR>know—just</NOBR> when I was talking about the utter washout Stalin’s Five Year Plan was turning out. I know the idea <SPAN class="ft22">woman </SPAN>brought the idea of the position of women in Russia into my mind. And I know we hadn’t got on to Russia until pretty near the end of our talk.”</P>
<P class="p330 ft3">“You can’t pin it down more definitely than that?” <NOBR>“N-no.</NOBR> It must have been roughly within the last <NOBR>half-hour.”</NOBR> “It was after the train had stopped?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The other nodded. “Yes, I’m almost sure it was.”</P>
<P class="p68 ft5">“Well, we will pass from that. Have you ever been in America, Colonel Arbuthnot?” “Never. Don’t want to go.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3"><NOBR>“Armstrong—Armstrong—I’ve</NOBR> known two or three Armstrongs. There was Tommy Armstrong in the <NOBR>60th—you</NOBR> don’t mean him? And Selby <NOBR>Armstrong—he</NOBR> was killed on the Somme.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“I mean the Colonel Armstrong who married an American wife and whose only child was kidnapped and killed.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p138 ft3">“Ah, yes, I remember reading about <NOBR>that—shocking</NOBR> affair. I don’t think I actually ever came across the fellow, though of course I knew of him. Toby Armstrong. Nice fellow. Everybody liked him. He had a very distinguished career. Got the V.C.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The man who was killed last night was the man responsible for the murder of Colonel Armstrong’s child.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Arbuthnot’s face grew rather grim. “Then in my opinion the swine deserved what he got. Though I would have preferred to see him properly <NOBR>hanged—or</NOBR> electrocuted, I suppose, over there.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“In fact, Colonel Arbuthnot, you prefer law and order to private vengeance?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well, you can’t go about having blood feuds and stabbing each other like Corsicans or the Mafia,” said the Colonel. “Say what you like, trial by jury is a sound system.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or two.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes,” he said. I am sure that would be your view. Well, Colonel Arbuthnot, I do not think there is anything more I have to ask you. There is nothing you yourself can recall last night that in any way snuck <NOBR>you—or</NOBR> shall we say strikes you now, looking <NOBR>back—as</NOBR> suspicious?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot considered for a moment or two.</P>
<P class="p331 ft3">“No,” he said. “Nothing at all. <NOBR>Unless—”</NOBR> he hesitated. “But yes, continue, I pray of you.”</P>
<P class="p189 ft5">“Well, it’s nothing really,” said the Colonel slowly. “But you said <SPAN class="ft4">anything</SPAN>.” “Yes, yes. Go on.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh! it’s nothing. A mere detail. But as I got back to my compartment I noticed that the door of the one beyond <NOBR>mine—the</NOBR> end one, you <NOBR>know—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, No. 16.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, the door of it was not quite closed. And the fellow inside peered out in a furtive sort of way. Then he pulled the door to quickly. Of course I know there’s nothing in <NOBR>that—but</NOBR> it just struck me as a bit odd. I mean, it’s quite usual to open a door and stick your head out if you want to see anything. But it was the furtive way he did it that caught my attention.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3"><NOBR>“Ye-es,”</NOBR> said Poirot doubtfully.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I told you there was nothing to it,” said Arbuthnot, apologetically. “But you know what it <NOBR>is—early</NOBR> hours of the <NOBR>morning—everything</NOBR> very still. The thing had a sinister <NOBR>look—like</NOBR> a detective story. All nonsense really.”</P>
<P class="p332 ft5">He rose. “Well, if you don’t want me any <NOBR>more—”</NOBR> “Thank you, Colonel Arbuthnot, there is nothing else.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The soldier hesitated for a minute. His first natural distaste for being questioned by “foreigners” had evaporated.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“About Miss Debenham,” he said rather awkwardly. “You can take it from me that she’s all right. She’s a <SPAN class="ft22">pukka sahib</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Flushing a little, he withdrew.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“What,” asked Dr. Constantine with interest, “does a <SPAN class="ft4">pukka sahib </SPAN>mean?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It means,” said Poirot, “that Miss Debenham’s father and brothers were at the same kind of school as Colonel Arbuthnot was.”</P>
<P class="p122 ft3">“Oh! said Dr. Constantine, disappointed. “Then it has nothing to do with the crime at all.” “Exactly,”, said, Poirot.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He fell into a reverie, beating a light tattoo on the table. Then he looked up.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a pipe,” he said. “In the compartment of Mr. Ratchett I found a <NOBR>pipe-cleaner.</NOBR> Mr. Ratchett smoked only cigars.”</P>

<P class="p4 ft3">“He is the only man so far who admits to smoking a pipe. And he knew of Colonel <NOBR>Armstrong—perhaps</NOBR> actually did know him, though he won’t admit it.”</P>
<P class="p333 ft5">“So you think it <NOBR>possible—?”</NOBR> Poirot shook his head violently.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is just <NOBR>it—it</NOBR> is <NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">im</SPAN>possible—quite</NOBR> <NOBR>impossible—that</NOBR> an honourable, slightly stupid, upright Englishman should stab an enemy twelve times with a knife! Do you not feel, my friends, how impossible it is?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“That is the psychology,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“And one must respect the psychology. This crime has a signature, and it is certainly not the signature of Colonel Arbuthnot. But now to our next interview.”</P>

<P class="p334 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF MR. HARDMAN</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">The last of the <NOBR>first-class</NOBR> passengers to be interviewed, Mr. Hardman, was the big flamboyant American who had shared a table with the Italian and the valet.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He wore a somewhat loud check suit, a pink shirt, and a flashy <NOBR>tie-pin,</NOBR> and was rolling something round his tongue as he entered the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> He had a big, fleshy, <NOBR>coarse-featured</NOBR> face, with a <NOBR>good-humoured</NOBR> expression.</P>
<P class="p335 ft3">“Morning, gentlemen,” he said. “What can I do for you?” “You have heard of this murder, <NOBR>Mr.—er—Hardman?”</NOBR> “Sure.” He shifted the chewing gum deftly.</P>
<P class="p336 ft5">“We are of necessity interviewing all the passengers on the train.” “That’s all right by me. Guess that’s the only way to tackle the job.” Poirot consulted the passport lying in front of him.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“You are Cyrus Bethman Hardman, United States subject, <NOBR>forty-one</NOBR> years of age, travelling salesman for typewriting ribbons?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“O.K. That’s me.”</P>
<P class="p245 ft5">you are travelling from Stamboul to Paris?” “That’s so.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Reason?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Business.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Do you always travel <NOBR>first-class,</NOBR> Mr. Hardman?”</P>
<P class="p337 ft5">“Yes, sir. The firm pays my travelling expenses. “ He winked. “Now, Mr. Hardman, we come to the events of last night.” The American nodded.</P>
<P class="p338 ft3">“What can you tell us about the matter?” “Exactly nothing at all.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Ah, that is a pity. Perhaps, Mr. Hardman, you will tell us exactly what you did last night from dinner onwards?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">For the first time the American did not seem ready with his reply. At last he said: “Excuse me, gentlemen, but just who are you? Put me wise.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“This is M. Bouc, a director of the Compagnie des Wagons Lits. This gentleman is the doctor who examined the body.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And you yourself?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I am Hercule Poirot. I am engaged by the company to investigate this matter.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I’ve heard of you,” said Mr. Hardman. He reflected a minute or two longer. “Guess I’d better come clean.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It will certainly be advisable for you to tell us all you know,” said Poirot drily.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“You’d have said a mouthful if there was anything I <SPAN class="ft4">did </SPAN>know. But I don’t. I know nothing at <NOBR>all—just</NOBR> as I said. But I <SPAN class="ft4">ought </SPAN>to know something. That’s what makes me sore. I <SPAN class="ft4">ought </SPAN>to.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Please explain, Mr. Hardman.”</P>

<P class="p138 ft3">Mr. Hardman sighed, removed the chewing gum, and dived into a pocket. At the same time his whole personality seemed to undergo a change. He became less of a stage character and more of a real person. The resonant nasal tones of his voice became modified.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“That passport’s a bit of bluff,” he said. “That’s who I really am.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot scrutinised the card flipped across to him. M. Bouc peered over his shoulder.</P>
<P class="p339 ft3">Poirot knew the name as that of one of the <NOBR>best-known</NOBR> and most reputable private detective agencies in New York.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Now, Mr. Hardman,” he said, “let us hear the meaning of this.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Sure. Things came about this way. I’d come over to Europe trailing a couple of crooks— nothing to do with this business. The chase ended in Stamboul. I wired the Chief and got his instructions to return, and I would have been making my tracks back to little old New York when I got this.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">He pushed across a letter.</P>
<P class="p69 ft3">THE TOKATLLAN HOTEL</P>
<P class="p69 ft3">Dear Sir:</P>
<P class="p340 ft3">You have been pointed out to me as an operative of the McNeil Detective Agency. Kindly report at my suite at four o’clock this afternoon.</P>
<P class="p341 ft3">S. E. RATCHETT</P>
<P class="p72 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Eh bien<SPAN class="ft3">?”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I reported at the time stated, and Mr. Ratchett put me wise to the situation. He showed me a couple of letters he’d got.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“He was alarmed?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Pretended not to be, but he was rattled, all right. He put up a proposition to me. I was to travel by the same train as he did to Parrus and see that nobody got him. Well, gentlemen, I <SPAN class="ft4">did </SPAN>travel by the same train, and in spite of me, somebody <SPAN class="ft4">did </SPAN>get him. I certainly feel sore about it. It doesn’t look any too good for me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Did he give you any indication of the line you were to take?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Sure. He had it all taped out. It was his idea that I should travel in the compartment alongside his. Well, that blew up right at the start. The only place I could get was berth No. 16, and I had a job getting that. I guess the conductor likes to keep that compartment up his sleeve. But that’s neither here nor there. When I looked all round the situation, it seemed to me that No. 16 was a</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">pretty good strategic position. There was only the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> in front of the Stamboul sleeping- car, and the door onto the platform at the front end was barred at night. The only way a thug could come was through the <NOBR>rear-end</NOBR> door to the platform, or along the train from the rear, and in either case he’d have to pass right by my compartment.”</P>
<P class="p342 ft5">“You had no idea, I suppose, of the identity of the possible assailant?” “Well, I knew what he looked like. Mr. Ratchett described him to me.” “What?”</P>
<P class="p343 ft3">All three men leaned forward eagerly. Hardman went on.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“A small <NOBR>man—dark—with</NOBR> a womanish kind of voice. That’s what the old man said. Said, too, that he didn’t think it would be the first night out, More likely the second or third.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“He knew something,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p81 ft5">“He certainly knew more than he told his secretary,” commented Poirot thoughtfully. “Did he tell you anything about this enemy of his? Did he, for instance, say <SPAN class="ft4">why </SPAN>his life was threatened?” “No, he was kinda reticent about that part of it. just said the <NOBR>fellow-was</NOBR> out for his blood and</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">meant to get it.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“A small <NOBR>man—dark—with</NOBR> a womanish voice,” repeated Poirot thoughtfully. Then, fixing a sharp glance on Hardman, he asked: “You knew who he really was, of course?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Which, Mister?”</P>
<P class="p344 ft5">“Ratchett. You recognised him?” “I don’t get you.”</P>
<P class="p345 ft3">“Ratchett was Cassetti, the Armstrong murderer.” Mr. Hardman gave vent to a prolonged whistle.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That certainly is some surprise!” he said. “Yes, <SPAN class="ft4">sir</SPAN>! No, I didn’t recognise him. I was away out West when that case came on. I suppose I saw photos of him in the papers, but I wouldn’t recognise my own mother when a newspaper photographer got through with her. Well, I don’t doubt that a few people had it in for Cassetti all right.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Do you know of anyone connected with the Armstrong case who answers to that description: <NOBR>small—dark—womanish</NOBR> voice?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Hardman reflected a minute or two. “It’s hard to say. Pretty nearly everyone connected with that case is dead.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“There was the girl who threw herself out of the window, remember.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Sure. That’s a good point, that. She was a foreigner of some kind. Maybe she had some Wop relations. But you’ve got to remember that there were other cases besides the Armstrong one. Cassetti had been running this kidnapping stunt for some time. You can’t concentrate on that only.”</P>
<P class="p298 ft3">Ah, but we have reason to believe that this crime <SPAN class="ft22">is </SPAN>connected with the Armstrong case.” Mr. Hardman cocked an inquiring eye. Poirot did not respond. The American shook his head. “I can’t call to mind anybody answering that description in the Armstrong case,” he said</P>
<P class="p346 ft3">slowly. “But of course I wasn’t in it and didn’t know much about it.” “Well, continue your narrative, Mr. Hardman.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There’s very little to tell. I got my sleep in the daytime and stayed awake on the watch at night. Nothing suspicious happened the first night. Last night was the same, as far as I was concerned. I had my door a little ajar and watched. No stranger passed.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are sure of that, Mr. Hardman?”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“I’m plumb certain. Nobody got on that train from outside, and nobody came along the train from the rear carriages. I’ll take my oath on that.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Could you see the conductor from your position?”</P>
<P class="p347 ft5">“Sure. He sits on that little seat almost flush with my door.” “Did he leave that seat at all after the train stopped at Vincovci?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That was the last station? Why, yes, he answered a couple of <NOBR>bells—that</NOBR> would be just after the train came to a halt for good. Then, after that, he went past me into the rear <NOBR>coach—was</NOBR> there about a quarter of an hour. There was a bell ringing like mad and he came back running. I stepped out into the corridor to see what it was all <NOBR>about—felt</NOBR> a mite nervous, you understand— but it was only the American dame. She was raising hell about something or other, I grinned. Then he went on to another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water for someone. After that he settled down in his seat till he went up to the far end to make somebody’s bed up. I don’t think he stirred after that until about five o’clock this morning.”</P>
<P class="p348 ft3">“Did he doze off at all?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That I can’t say. He may have.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot nodded. Automatically his hands straightened the papers on the table. He picked up the official card once more.</P>
<P class="p349 ft5">“Be so good as just to initial this,” he said. The other complied.</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“There is no one, I suppose, who can confirm your story of your identity, Mr. Hardman?” “On this train? Well, not exactly. Unless it might be young MacQueen. I know him well</P>
<P class="p106 ft5"><NOBR>enough—I’ve</NOBR> seen him in his father’s office in New York. But that’s not to say he’ll remember me from a crowd of other operatives. No, Mr. Poirot, you’ll have to wait and cable New York when the snow lets up. But it’s O.K. I’m not telling the tale. Well, so long, gentlemen. Pleased to have met you, Mr. Poirot.”</P>
<P class="p350 ft3">Poirot proffered his cigarette case. “But perhaps you prefer a pipe?” “Not me.” He helped himself, then strode briskly off.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The three men looked at each other.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You think he is genuine?” asked Dr. Constantine.</P>
<P class="p79 ft5">“Yes, yes. I know the type. Besides, it is a story that would be very easy to disprove.” “He has given us a piece of very interesting evidence,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, indeed.”</P>
<P class="p264 ft23">“A small <NOBR>man—dark—with</NOBR> a <NOBR>high-pitched</NOBR> voice,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully. “A description which applies to no one on the train,” said Poirot.</P>

<P class="p352 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE ITALIAN</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">“And now,” said Poirot with a twinkle in his eye, “we will delight the heart of M. Bouc and see the Italian.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Antonio Foscarelli came into the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> with a swift, <NOBR>cat-like</NOBR> tread. His face beamed. It was a typical Italian face, <NOBR>sunny-looking</NOBR> and swarthy.</P>
<P class="p353 ft3">He spoke French well and fluently with only a slight accent. “Your name is Antonio Foscarelli?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“You are, I see, a naturalised American subject?”</P>
<P class="p354 ft5">The American grinned. “Yes, Monsieur. It is better for my business.” “You are an agent for Ford motor cars?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, you <NOBR>see—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">A voluble exposition followed. At the end of it anything that the three men did not know about Foscarelli’s business methods, his journeys, his income, and his opinion of the United States and most European countries seemed a negligible factor. This was not a man who had to have information dragged from him. It gushed out.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">His <NOBR>good-natured,</NOBR> childish face beamed with satisfaction as, with a last eloquent gesture, he paused and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief.</P>
<P class="p355 ft5">“So you see,” he said. “I do big business. I am up to date. I understand salesmanship!” “You have been in the United States, then, for the last ten years on and off.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Yes, Monsieur. Ah! well do I remember the day I first took the <NOBR>boat—to</NOBR> go to America, so far away! My mother, my little <NOBR>sister—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot cut short the flood of reminiscence.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“During your sojourn in the United States, did you ever come across the deceased?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Never. But I know the type. Oh! yes.” He snapped his fingers expressively. “It is very respectable, very <NOBR>well-dressed,</NOBR> but underneath it is all wrong. Out of my experience I should say he was the big crook. I give you my opinion for what it is worth.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Your opinion is quite right,” said Poirot drily. “Ratchett was Cassetti, the kidnapper.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“What did I tell you? I have learned to be very <NOBR>acute—to</NOBR> read the face. It is necessary. Only in America do they teach you the proper way to sell. <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You remember the Armstrong case?”</P>
<P class="p304 ft3">“I do not quite remember. The name, yes? It was a little girl, a baby, was it not?” “Yes, a very tragic affair.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The Italian seemed the first person to demur to this view.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Ah! well, these things they happen,” he said philosophically, “in a great civilisation such as <NOBR>America—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p105 ft3">Poirot cut him short. “Did you ever come across any members of the Armstrong family?” “No, I do not think so. It is difficult to say. I will give you some figures. Last year alone, I</P>
<P class="p6 ft5"><NOBR>sold—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Monsieur, pray confine yourself to the point.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The Italian’s hands flung themselves out in a gesture of apology. “A thousand pardons.”</P>

<P class="p4 ft3">“With pleasure. I stay here as long as I can. It is more amusing. I talk to the American gentleman at my table. He sells typewriter ribbons. Then I go back to my compartment. It is empty. The miserable John Bull who shares it with me is away attending to his master. At last he comes <NOBR>back—very</NOBR> long face as usual. He will not <NOBR>talk—says</NOBR> yes and no. A miserable race, the <NOBR>English—not</NOBR> sympathetic. He sits in the corner, very stiff, reading a book, Then the conductor comes and makes our beds.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Nos. 4 and 5,” murmured Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“Exactly—the</NOBR> end compartment. Mine is the upper berth. I get up there. I smoke and read. The little Englishman has, I think, the toothache. He gets out a little bottle of stuff that smells very strong. He lies in bed and groans. Presently I sleep. Whenever I wake I hear him groaning.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Do you know if he left the carriage at all during the night?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I do not think so. That, I should hear. The light from the <NOBR>corridor—one</NOBR> wakes up automatically thinking it is the customs examination at some frontier.”</P>
<P class="p356 ft5">“Did he ever speak of his master? Ever express any animus against him?” “I tell you he did not speak. He was not sympathetic. A fish.”</P>
<P class="p357 ft3">“You smoke, you <NOBR>say—a</NOBR> pipe, cigarettes, cigar?” “Cigarettes only.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Poirot proffered one, which he accepted.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Have you ever been to Chicago?” inquired M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh! <NOBR>yes—a</NOBR> fine <NOBR>city—but</NOBR> I know best New York, Cleveland, Detroit. You have been to the States? No? You should go. <NOBR>It—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot pushed a sheet of paper across to him.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“If you will sign this, and put your permanent address, please.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The Italian wrote with a flourish. Then he rose, his smile as engaging as ever.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That is all? You do not require me further? Good day to you, Messieurs. I wish we could get out of the snow. I have an appointment in Milan.” He shook his head sadly. “I shall lose the business.” He departed.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked at his friend.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“He has been a long time in America,” said M. Bouc, “and he is an Italian, and Italians use the knife! And they are great liars! I do not like Italians.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Ça se voit</SPAN>,” said Poirot with a smile “Well, it may be that you are right, but I will point out to you, my friend, that there is absolutely no evidence against the man.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And what about the psychology? Do not Italians stab?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Assuredly,” said Poirot. “Especially in the heat of a quarrel. But <NOBR>this—this</NOBR> is a different kind of crime. I have the little idea, my friend, that this is a crime very carefully planned and staged. It is a <NOBR>far-sighted,</NOBR> <NOBR>long-headed</NOBR> crime. it is <NOBR>not—how</NOBR> shall I express <NOBR>it?—a</NOBR> <SPAN class="ft4">Latin </SPAN>crime. It is a crime that shows traces of a cool, resourceful, deliberate <NOBR>brain—I</NOBR> think an <NOBR>Anglo-Saxon</NOBR> <NOBR>brain—”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p358 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF MISS DEBENHAM</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">When Mary Debenham entered the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> she confirmed Poirot’s previous estimate of her. She was very neatly dressed in a little black suit with a French grey shirt, and the smooth waves of her dark head were neat and unruffled. Her manner was as calm and unruffled as her hair.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She sat down opposite Poirot and M. Bouc and looked at them inquiringly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Your name is Mary Hermione Debenham and you are <NOBR>twenty-six</NOBR> years of age?” began Poirot.</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“English?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Will you be so kind, Mademoiselle, as to write down your permanent address on this piece of paper?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She complied. Her writing was clear and legible.</P>
<P class="p359 ft5">“And now, Mademoiselle, what have you to tell us of the affair last night?” “I am afraid I have nothing to tell you. I went to bed and slept.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Does it distress you very much, Mademoiselle, that a crime has been committed on this train?”</P>
<P class="p360 ft23">The question was clearly unexpected. Her grey eyes widened a little. “I don’t quite understand you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It was a perfectly simple question that I asked you, Mademoiselle. I will repeat it. Are you very much distressed that a crime should have been committed on this train?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I have not really thought about it from that point of view. No, I cannot say that I am at all distressed.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“A <NOBR>crime—it</NOBR> is all in the day’s work to you, eh?”</P>
<P class="p361 ft5">“It is naturally an unpleasant thing to have happen,” said Mary Debenham quietly. “You are very <NOBR>Anglo-Saxon,</NOBR> Mademoiselle. <SPAN class="ft4">Vous n’éprouvez pas d’émotion</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She smiled a little. “I am afraid I cannot have hysterics to prove my sensibility. After all, people die every day.”</P>
<P class="p362 ft5">“They die, yes. But murder is a little more rare.” “Oh! certainly.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You were not acquainted with the dead man?”</P>
<P class="p363 ft5">“I saw him for the first time when lunching here yesterday.” “And how did he strike you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I hardly noticed him.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“He did not impress you as an evil personality?”</P>
<P class="p148 ft5">She shrugged her shoulders slightly. “Really, I cannot say I thought about it.” Poirot looked at her keenly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute my inquiries,” he said with a twinkle. “Not so, you think, would an English inquiry be conducted. There everything would be cut and <NOBR>dried—it</NOBR> would be all kept to the <NOBR>facts—a</NOBR> <NOBR>well-ordered</NOBR> business. But I, Mademoiselle, have my little originalities.

<P class="p197 ft3">character, and I frame my questions accordingly. just a little minute ago I am asking questions of a gentleman who wants to tell me all his ideas on every subject. Well, him I keep strictly to the point. I want him to answer yes or no. This or that. And then you come. I see at once that you will be orderly and methodical. You will confine yourself to the matter in hand. Your answers will be brief and to the point. And because, Mademoiselle, human nature is perverse, I ask of you quite different questions. I ask what you feel, what you think. It does not please you, this method?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“If you will forgive my saying so, it seems somewhat of a waste of time. Whether or not I liked Mr. Ratchett’s face does not seem likely to be helpful in finding out who killed him.”</P>
<P class="p295 ft3">“Do you know who the man Ratchett really was, Mademoiselle?” She nodded. “Mrs. Hubbard has been telling everyone.”</P>
<P class="p364 ft5">“And what do you think of the Armstrong affair?” “It was quite abominable,” said the girl crisply. Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.</P>
<P class="p188 ft3">“You are travelling from Baghdad, I believe, Miss Debenham?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p365 ft5">“To London?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What have you been doing in Baghdad?”</P>
<P class="p366 ft5">“I have been acting as governess to two children.” “Are you returning to your post after your holiday?” “I am not sure.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why is that?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Baghdad is rather out of things. I think I should prefer a post in London if I can hear of a suitable one.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I see. I thought, perhaps, you might be going to be married.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Miss Debenham did not reply. She raised her eyes and looked Poirot full in the face. The glance said plainly: “You are impertinent.”</P>
<P class="p249 ft5">“What is your opinion of the lady who shares your <NOBR>compartment—Miss</NOBR> Ohlsson?” “She seems a pleasant, simple creature.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What colour is her <NOBR>dressing-gown?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Mary Debenham stared. “A kind of brownish <NOBR>colour—natural</NOBR> wool.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Ah! I may mention without indiscretion, I hope, that I noticed the colour of your dressing- gown on the way from Aleppo to Stamboul. A pale mauve, I believe.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, that is right.”</P>
<P class="p367 ft5">“Have you any other <NOBR>dressing-gown,</NOBR> Mademoiselle? A scarlet <NOBR>dressing-gown,</NOBR> for example?” “No, that is not mine.”</P>
<P class="p87 ft3">Poirot leant forward. He was like a cat pouncing on a mouse. “Whose, then?’</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The girl drew back a little, startled. “I don’t know. What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“You do not say, ‘No, I have no such thing.’ You say, ‘That is not mine.’ Meaning that such a thing does belong to someone else.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She nodded.</P>
<P class="p368 ft5">“Somebody else on this train?” ‘Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Whose is it?”</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“I told you just now: I don’t know. I woke up this morning about five o’clock with the feeling that the train had been standing still for a long time. I opened the door and looked out into the corridor, thinking we might be at a station. I saw someone in a scarlet kimono some way down the corridor.”</P>
<P class="p369 ft3">“And you don’t know who it was? Was she fair, or dark, or <NOBR>grey-haired?”</NOBR> “I can’t say. She had on a shingle cap and I only saw the back of her head.” “And in build?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Tallish and slim, I should judge, but it’s difficult to say. The kimono was embroidered with dragons.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes, yes, that is <NOBR>right—dragons.”</NOBR> He was silent a minute. He murmured to himself. “I cannot understand. I cannot understand. None of this makes sense.”</P>
<P class="p214 ft3">Then, looking up, he said: “I need not keep you further, Mademoiselle.” “Oh!” She seemed rather taken aback but rose promptly.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">In the doorway, however, she hesitated a minute and then came back.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The Swedish <NOBR>lady—Miss</NOBR> Ohlsson, is <NOBR>it?—seems</NOBR> rather worried. She says you told her she was the last person to see this man alive. She thinks, I believe, that you suspect her on that account. Can’t I tell her that she has made a mistake? Really, you know, she is the kind of creature who wouldn’t hurt a fly.” She smiled a little as she spoke.</P>
<P class="p314 ft3">“What time was it that she went to fetch the aspirin from Mrs. Hubbard?” “Just after <NOBR>half-past</NOBR> ten.”</P>
<P class="p240 ft5">“She was <NOBR>away—how</NOBR> long?” “About five minutes.”</P>
<P class="p370 ft3">“Did she leave the compartment again during the night?” “No.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft5">Poirot turned to the doctor. “Could Ratchett have been killed as early as that?” The doctor shook his head.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Then I think you can reassure your friend, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Thank you.” She smiled suddenly at him, a smile that invited sympathy. “She’s like a sheep, you know. She gets anxious and bleats.”</P>

<P class="p371 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE GERMAN <NOBR>LADY’S-MAID</NOBR></P>
<P class="p202 ft3">M. Bouc was looking at his friend curiously.</P>
<P class="p372 ft3">“I do not quite understand you, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>. You were trying to <NOBR>do—what?”</NOBR> “I was searching for a flaw, my friend.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“A flaw?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“Yes—in</NOBR> the armour of a young lady’s <NOBR>self-possession.</NOBR> I wished to shake her <NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">sang-froid</SPAN>.</NOBR> Did I succeed? I do not know. But I know this: she did not expect me to tackle the matter as I did.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You suspect her,” said M. Bow slowly. “But why? She seems a very charming young lady— the last person in the world to be mixed up in a crime of this kind.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I agree,” said Constantine. “She is cold. She has not emotions. She would not stab a man— she would sue him in the law courts.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot sighed.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You must, both of you, get rid of your obsession that this is an unpremeditated and sudden crime. As for the reasons why I suspect Miss Debenham, there are two. One is because of something that I overheard, and that you do not as yet know.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He retailed to them the curious interchange of phrases he had overheard on the journey from Aleppo.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is curious, certainly,” said M. Bouc when he had finished. “It needs explaining. If it means what you suspect it means, then they are both of them in it <NOBR>together—she</NOBR> and the stiff Englishman.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">Poirot nodded.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“And that is just what is not borne out by the facts,” he said. “See you, if they were both in this together, what should we expect to find? That each of them would provide an alibi for the other. Is not that so? But <NOBR>no—that</NOBR> does not happen. Miss Debenham’s alibi is provided by a Swedish woman whom she has never seen before, and Colonel Arbuthnot’s alibi is vouched for by MacQueen, the dead mans secretary. No, that solution of the puzzle is too easy.”</P>
<P class="p373 ft3">“You said there was another reason for your suspicions of her,” M. Bouc, reminded him. Poirot smiled.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! but that is only psychological. I ask myself, is it possible for Miss Debenham to have planned this crime? Behind this business, I am convinced, there is a cool, intelligent, resourceful brain. Miss Debenham answers to that description.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc shook his head. “I think you are wrong, my friend. I do not see that young English girl as a criminal.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! Well,” said Poirot, picking up the last passport. “To the final name on our list. Hildegarde Schmidt, <NOBR>lady’s-maid.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Summoned by the attendant, Hildegarde Schmidt came into the restaurant car and stood waiting respectfully.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot motioned her to sit down.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She did so, folding her hands and waiting placidly till he questioned her. She seemed a placid creature <NOBR>altogether—eminently</NOBR> respectable, perhaps not <NOBR>over-intelligent.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p81 ft5">“We want to know as much as possible about what happened last night,” he said. “We know that you cannot give us much information bearing on the crime itself, but you may have seen or heard something that, while conveying nothing to you, may be valuable to us. You understand?” She did not seem to. Her broad, kindly face remained set in its expression of placid stupidity</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">as she answered:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not know anything, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p214 ft3">“Well, for instance you know that your mistress sent for you last night.” “That, yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Do you remember the time?”</P>
<P class="p374 ft5">“I do not, Monsieur. I was asleep, you see, when the attendant came and told me.” “Yes, yes. Was it usual for you to be sent for in this way?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It was not unusual, Monsieur. The gracious lady often required attention at night. She did not sleep well.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>, then, you received the summons and you got up. Did you put on a <NOBR>dressing-gown?”</NOBR> “No, Monsieur, I put on a few clothes. I would not like to go in to her Excellency in my</P>
<P class="p6 ft3"><NOBR>dressing-gown.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“And yet it is a very nice <NOBR>dressing-gown—scarlet,</NOBR> is it not?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She stared at him. “It is a dark blue flannel <NOBR>dressing-gown,</NOBR> Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah! continue. A little pleasantry on my part, that is all. So you went along to Madame la Princesse. And what did you do when you got there?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I gave her massage, Monsieur, and then I read aloud. I do not read aloud very well, but her Excellency says that is all the <NOBR>better—so</NOBR> it sends her better to sleep. When she became sleepy, Monsieur, she told me to go, so I closed the book and I returned to my own compartment.”</P>
<P class="p375 ft3">“Do you know what time that was?” “No, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p376 ft5">“Well, how long had you been with Madame la Princesse?” “About half an hour, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Good, continue.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“First, I fetched her Excellency an extra rug from my compartment. It was very cold in spite of the heating. I arranged the rug over her, and she wished me good night. I poured her out some mineral water. Then I turned out the light and left her.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And then?”</P>
<P class="p377 ft3">“There is nothing more, Monsieur. I returned to my carriage and went to sleep.” “And you met no one in the corridor?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“No, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You did not, for instance, see a lady in a scarlet kimono with dragons on it?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Her mild eyes bulged at him. “No, indeed, Monsieur. There was nobody about except the attendant. Everyone was asleep.”</P>
<P class="p344 ft5">“But you did see the conductor?” “Yes, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What was he doing!”</P>

<P class="p378 ft3">“He came out of one of the compartments, Monsieur.” “What?” M. Bouc leaned forward. “Which one?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Hildegarde Schmidt looked frightened again, and Poirot cast a reproachful glance at his friend.</P>
<P class="p70 ft23">“Naturally,” he said. “The conductor often has to answer bells at night. Do you remember which compartment it was?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It was about the middle of the coach, Monsieur. Two or three doors from Madame la Princesse.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“Ah! tell us, if you please, exactly where this was and what happened?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“He nearly ran into me, Monsieur. It was when I was returning from my compartment to that of the Princess with the rug.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And he came out of a compartment and almost collided with you. In which direction was he going?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“Towards me, Monsieur. He apologised and passed on down the corridor towards the dining- car. A bell began ringing, but I do not think he answered it.” She paused and then said: “I do not understand. How is <NOBR>it—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot spoke reassuringly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is just a question of time,” he said. “All a matter of routine. This poor conductor, he seems to have had a busy <NOBR>night—first</NOBR> waking you and then answering bells.”</P>
<P class="p287 ft3">“It was not the same conductor who woke me, Monsieur. It was another one.” “Ah! another one! Had you seen him before?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“No, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p229 ft5"><NOBR>“Ah!—do</NOBR> you think you would recognise him if you saw him?” “I think so, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Poirot murmured something in M. Bouc’s ear. The latter got up and went to the door to give an order.</P>
<P class="p188 ft5">Poirot was continuing his questions in an easy, friendly manner. “Have you ever been to America, Fräulein Schmidt?” “Never, Monsieur. It must be a fine country.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“You have heard, perhaps, who this man who was killed really <NOBR>was—that</NOBR> he was responsible for the death of a little child?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Yes, I have heard, Monsieur. It was <NOBR>abominable—wicked.</NOBR> The good God should not allow such things. We are not so wicked as that in Germany.”</P>
<P class="p218 ft5">Tears had come into the woman’s eyes. Her strong, motherly soul was moved. “It was an abominable crime,” said Poirot gravely.</P>
<P class="p225 ft3">He drew a scrap of cambric from his pocket and handed it to her. “Is this your handkerchief, Fräulein Schmidt?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">There was a moment’s silence as the woman examined it. She looked up after a minute. The colour had mounted a little in her face.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Ah! no, indeed. It is not mine, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It has the initial H, you see. That is why I thought it was yours.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Ah! Monsieur, it is a lady’s handkerchief, that. A very expensive handkerchief. Embroidered by hand. It comes from Paris, I should say.”</P>
<P class="p364 ft5">“It is not yours and you do not know whose it is?” “I? Oh! no, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Of the three listening, only Poirot caught the nuance of hesitation in the reply.</P>

<P class="p80 ft3">“The three <NOBR>sleeping-car</NOBR> attendants are coming in. Will you be so kind as to tell me which is the one you met last night as you were going with the rug to the Princess?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The three men entered. Pierre Michel, the big blond conductor of the <NOBR>Athens-Paris</NOBR> coach, and the stout burly conductor of the Bucharest one.</P>
<P class="p379 ft3">Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them and immediately shook her head. “No, Monsieur,” she said. “None of these is the man I saw last night.” “But these are the only conductors on the train. You must be mistaken.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I am quite sure, Monsieur. These are all tall, big men. The one I saw was small and dark. He had a little moustache. His voice when he said ‘<SPAN class="ft22">Pardon</SPAN>’ was weak, like a woman’s. Indeed, I remember him very well, Monsieur.”</P>

<P class="p380 ft11">SUMMARY OF THE PASSENGERS’ EVIDENCE</P>
<P class="p202 ft3">“A small dark man with a womanish voice,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The three conductors and Hildegarde Schmidt had been dismissed.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc made a despairing gesture. “But I understand <NOBR>nothing—but</NOBR> nothing, of all of this! The enemy that this Ratchett spoke of, he was then on the train after all? But where is he now? How can he have vanished into thin air? My head, it whirls. Say something, then, my friend, I implore you. Show me how the impossible can be possible!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft23">“It is a good phrase that,” said Poirot. “The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Explain to me, then, quickly, what actually happened on the train last night.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I am not a magician, <SPAN class="ft4">mon cher</SPAN>. I am, like you, a very puzzled man. This affair advances in a very strange manner.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It does not advance at all. It stays where it was.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot shook his head. “No, that is not true. We are more advanced. We know certain things. We have heard the evidence of the passengers.”</P>
<P class="p381 ft3">“And what has that told us? Nothing at all.” “I would not say that, my friend.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I exaggerate, perhaps. The American Hardman, and the German <NOBR>maid—yes,</NOBR> they have added something to our knowledge. That is to say, they have made the whole business more unintelligible than it was.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, no, no,” said Poirot soothingly.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc turned upon him. “Speak, then, let us hear the wisdom of Hercule Poirot.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Did I not tell you that I was, like you, a very puzzled man? But at least we can face our problem. We can arrange such facts as we have with order and method.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Pray continue, Monsieur,” said Dr. Constantine.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot cleared his throat and straightened a piece of <NOBR>blotting-paper.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Let us review the case as it stands at this moment. First, there are certain indisputable facts. This man, Ratchett or Cassetti, was stabbed in twelve places and died last night. That is fact one.”</P>
<P class="p382 ft3">“I grant it <NOBR>you—I</NOBR> grant it, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>,” said M. Bouc with a gesture of irony. Hercule Poirot was not at all put out. He continued calmly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I will pass over for the moment certain rather peculiar appearances which Dr. Constantine and I have already discussed together. I will come to them presently. The next fact of importance, to my mind, is the <SPAN class="ft4">time </SPAN>of the crime.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That, again, is one of the few things we do know,” said M. Bouc. “The crime was committed at a quarter past one this morning. Everything goes to show that that was so.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Not <SPAN class="ft22">everything</SPAN>. You exaggerate. There is, certainly, a fair amount of evidence to support that view.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“I am glad you admit that at least.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot went on calmly, unperturbed by the interruption. “We have before us three possibilities.</P>

<DIV id="id87_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p138 ft3"><NOBR>“(1)—that</NOBR> the crime was committed, as you say, at a quarter past one. This is supported by the evidence of the watch, by the evidence of Mrs. Hubbard, and by the evidence of the German woman, Hildegarde Schmidt. It agrees with the evidence of Dr. Constantine.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><NOBR>“(2)—that</NOBR> the crime was committed <SPAN class="ft4">later</SPAN>, and that the evidence of the watch was deliberately faked in order to mislead.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3"><NOBR>“(3)—that</NOBR> the crime was committed <SPAN class="ft22">earlier</SPAN>, and the evidence faked for the same reason as above.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“Now if we accept possibility (1) as the most likely to have occurred, and the one supported by most evidence, we must also accept certain facts arising from it. If the crime was committed at a quarter past one, the murderer cannot have left the train, and the questions arise: Where is he? And <SPAN class="ft22">who </SPAN>is he?</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“To begin with, let us examine the evidence carefully. We first hear of the existence of this <NOBR>man—the</NOBR> small dark man with a womanish <NOBR>voice—from</NOBR> the man Hardman. He says that Ratchett told him of this person and employed him to watch out for the man. There is no <SPAN class="ft22">evidence </SPAN>to support this; we have only Hardman’s word for it. Let us next examine the question: Is Hardman the person he pretends to be an operative of a New York detective agency?</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What to my mind is so interesting in this case is that we have none of the facilities afforded to the police. We cannot investigate the <SPAN class="ft22">bona fides </SPAN>of any of these people. We have to rely solely on deduction. That, to me, makes the matter very much more interesting. There is no routine work. It is all a matter of the intellect. I ask myself: Can we accept Hardman’s account of himself? I make my decision and I answer ‘Yes.’ I am of the opinion that we <SPAN class="ft22">can </SPAN>accept Hardman’s account of himself.”</P>
<P class="p383 ft3">“You rely on the intuition? What the Americans call ‘the hunch’?” asked Dr. Constantine. “Not at all. I regard the probabilities. Hardman is travelling with a false <NOBR>passport—that</NOBR> will at</P>
<P class="p106 ft5">once make him an object of suspicion. The first thing that the police will do when they do arrive upon the scene is to detain Hardman and cable as to whether his account of himself is true. In the case of many of the passengers, to establish their <SPAN class="ft4">bona fides </SPAN>will be difficult; in most cases it will probably not be attempted, especially since there seems nothing in the way of suspicion attaching to them. But in Hardman’s case it is simple. Either he is the person he represents himself to be, or he is not. Therefore I say that all will prove to be in order.”</P>
<P class="p348 ft3">“You acquit him of suspicion?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Not at all. You misunderstand me. For all I know, any American detective might have his own private reasons for wishing to murder Ratchett. No, what I am saying is that I think we <SPAN class="ft4">can </SPAN>accept Hardman’s own account of <SPAN class="ft4">himself</SPAN>. This story, then, that he tells of Ratchett’s seeking him out and employing him is not unlikely, and is most <NOBR>probably—though</NOBR> not of course <NOBR>certainly—true.</NOBR> If we are going to accept it as true, we must see if there is any confirmation of it. We find it in rather an unlikely <NOBR>place—in</NOBR> the evidence of Hildegarde Schmidt. Her description of the man she saw in Wagon Lit uniform tallies exactly. Is there any further confirmation of these two stories? There is. There is the button that Mrs. Hubbard found in her compartment. And there is also another corroborating statement which you may not have noticed.”</P>
<P class="p384 ft3">“What is that?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“The fact that both Colonel Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen mention that the conductor passed their carriage. They attached no importance to the fact, but, Messieurs, <SPAN class="ft22">Pierre Michel has declared that he did not leave his seat except on certain specified </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">occasions</SPAN>—none</NOBR> of which would take him down to the far end of the coach past the compartment in which Arbuthnot and MacQueen were sitting.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">“Therefore this story, the story of a small dark man with a womanish voice dressed in Wagon Lit uniform, rests on the testimony, direct or indirect, of four witnesses.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“One small point,” said Dr. Constantine. “If Hildegarde Schmidt’s story is true, how is it that the real conductor did not mention having seen her when he came to answer Mrs. Hubbard’s bell?”</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“That is explained, I think. When he arrived to answer Mrs. Hubbard, the maid was in with her mistress. When she finally returned to her own compartment, the conductor was in with Mrs. Hubbard.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">M. Bouc had been waiting with difficulty until they had finished.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes, yes, my friend,” he said impatiently to Poirot. “But whilst I admire your caution, your method of advancing a step at a time, I submit that you have not yet touched the point at issue. We are all agreed that this person exists. The point is, <SPAN class="ft22">where did he go</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot shook his head reprovingly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You are in error. You are inclined to put the cart before the horse. Before I ask myself, ‘<SPAN class="ft4">Where did this man vanish to</SPAN>?’ I ask myself, ‘<SPAN class="ft4">Did such a man really exist</SPAN>?’ Because, you see, if the man were an <NOBR>invention—a</NOBR> <NOBR>fabrication—how</NOBR> much easier to make him disappear! So I try to establish first that there really <SPAN class="ft4">is </SPAN>such a <NOBR>flesh-and-blood</NOBR> person.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And having arrived at the fact that there <NOBR>is—<SPAN class="ft22">eh</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> bien</SPAN>, where is he now?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There are only two answers to that, <SPAN class="ft4">mon cher</SPAN>. Either he is still hidden on the train in a place of such extraordinary ingenuity that we cannot even think of it; or else he is, as one might say, <SPAN class="ft4">two persons</SPAN>. That is, he is both <NOBR>himself—the</NOBR> man feared by M. <NOBR>Ratchett—and</NOBR> a passenger on the train so well disguised that M. Ratchett did not recognise him.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is an idea, that,” said M. Bouc, his face lighting up. Then it clouded over again. “But there is one <NOBR>objection—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot took the words out of his mouth.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“The height of the man. It is that you would say? With the exception of Mr. Ratchett’s valet, all the passengers are big <NOBR>men—the</NOBR> Italian, Colonel Arbuthnot, Hector MacQueen, Count Andrenyi. Well, that leaves us the <NOBR>valet—not</NOBR> a very likely supposition. But there is another possibility. Remember the ‘womanish’ voice. That gives us a choice of alternatives. The man may be disguised as a woman, or, alternatively, he may actually <SPAN class="ft22">be </SPAN>a woman. A tall woman dressed in men’s clothes would look small.”</P>
<P class="p385 ft3">“But surely Ratchett would have <NOBR>known—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Perhaps he <SPAN class="ft22">did </SPAN>know. Perhaps, already, this woman had attempted his life, wearing a mares clothes the better to accomplish her purpose. Ratchett may have guessed that she would use the same trick again, so he tells Hardman to look for a man. But he mentions, however, a womanish voice.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“It is a possibility,” said M. Bouc. <NOBR>“But—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Listen, my friend, I think that I should now tell you of certain inconsistencies noticed by Dr. Constantine.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He retailed at length the conclusions that he and the doctor had arrived at together from the nature of the dead man’s wounds. M. Bouc groaned and held his head again. “I know,” said Poirot sympathetically. “I know exactly how you feel. The head spins, does it not?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“The whole thing is a fantasy!” cried M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Exactly. It is <NOBR>absurd—improbable—it</NOBR> cannot be. So I myself have said. And yet, my friend, <SPAN class="ft22">there it is</SPAN>! One cannot escape from the facts.”</P>

<P class="p172 ft3">“Two murderers,” groaned M. Bouc. “And on the Orient <NOBR>Express—”</NOBR> The thought almost made him weep.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And now let us make the fantasy more fantastic,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Last night on the train, there are two mysterious strangers. There is the Wagon Lit attendant answering to the description given us by M. Hardman, and seen by Hildegarde Schmidt, Colonel Arbuthnot and M. MacQueen. There is also a woman in a red <NOBR>kimono—a</NOBR> tall slim woman, seen by Pierre Michel, Miss Debenham, M. MacQueen and myself (and smelt, I may say, by Colonel Arbuthnot!). Who was she? No one on the train admits to having a scarlet kimono. She, too, has vanished. Was she one and the same with the spurious Wagon Lit attendant? Or was she some quite distinct personality? Where are they, these two? And incidentally, where are the Wagon Lit uniform and the scarlet kimono?”</P>
<P class="p203 ft3">“Ah! that is something definite.” M. Bouc sprang up eagerly. “We must search all the passengers’ luggage. Yes, that will be something.”</P>
<P class="p386 ft3">Poirot rose also. “I will make a prophecy,” he said. “You know where they are?”</P>
<P class="p387 ft5">“I have a little idea.” “Where, then?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“You will find the scarlet kimono in the baggage of one of the men, and you will find the uniform of the Wagon Lit conductor in the baggage of Hildegarde Schmidt.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Hildegarde Schmidt? You <NOBR>think—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Not what you are thinking. I will put it like this. If Hildegarde Schmidt is guilty, the uniform may be found in her baggage. But if she is innocent, it <SPAN class="ft4">certainly </SPAN>will be.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“But <NOBR>how—”</NOBR> began M. Bouc and stopped. “What is this noise that approaches?” he cried. “It resembles a locomotive in motion.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The noise drew nearer. It consisted of shrill cries and protests in a woman’s voice. The door at the end of the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> burst open. Mrs. Hubbard burst in.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It’s too horrible!” she cried. It’s just too horrible. In my <NOBR>sponge-bag.</NOBR> My <NOBR>sponge-bag!</NOBR> A great <NOBR>knife—all</NOBR> over blood?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">And suddenly toppling forward, she fainted heavily on M. Bouc’s shoulder.</P>

<P class="p159 ft3">With more vigour than chivalry, A Bouc deposited the fainting lady with her head on the table. Dr. Constantine yelled for one of the restaurant attendants, who came at a run.</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“Keep her head so,” said the doctor. “If she revives give her a little cognac. You understand?” Then he hurried off after the other two. His interest lay wholly in the <NOBR>crime—swooning</NOBR></P>
<P class="p6 ft3"><NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> ladies did not interest him at all.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">It is possible that Mrs. Hubbard revived rather more quickly by these methods than she might otherwise have done. A few minutes later she was sitting up, sipping cognac from a glass proffered by the attendant, and talking once more.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I just can’t tell you how terrible it was! I don’t suppose anybody on this train can understand my feelings. I’ve always been very, very sensitive ever since I was a child. The mere sight of <NOBR>blood—<SPAN class="ft22">ugh</SPAN>!</NOBR> Why, even now I get faint when I think about it!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The attendant proffered the glass again. “<SPAN class="ft22">Encore un peu, Madame</SPAN>?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“D’you think I’d better? I’m a lifelong teetotaller. I never touch spirits or wine at any time. All my family are abstainers. Still, perhaps as this is only <NOBR>medicinal—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She sipped once more.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">In the meantime Poirot and M. Bouc, closely followed by Dr. Constantine, had hurried out of the restaurant car and along the corridor of the Stamboul coach towards Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">Every traveller on the train seemed to be congregated outside the door. The conductor, a harassed look on his face, was keeping them back.</P>
<P class="p389 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mais il n’y a rien à voir</SPAN>,” he said, and repeated the sentiment in several other languages. “Let me pass if you please,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Squeezing his rotundity past the obstructing passengers he entered the compartment, Poirot close behind him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I am glad you have come, Monsieur,” said the conductor with a sigh of relief. “Everyone has been trying to enter. The American <NOBR>lady—such</NOBR> screams as she <NOBR>gave—<SPAN class="ft4">ma</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> foi</SPAN>, I thought she too had been murdered! I came at a run, and there she was screaming like a mad woman; and she cried out that she must fetch you, and she departed screeching at the top of her voice and telling everybody whose carriage she passed what had occurred.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">He added, with a gesture of the hand: “<SPAN class="ft22">It </SPAN>is in there, Monsieur. I have not touched it.” Hanging on the handle of the door that gave access to the next compartment was a large-</P>
<P class="p106 ft5">checked rubber <NOBR>sponge-bag.</NOBR> Below it on the floor, just where it had fallen from Mrs. Hubbard’s hand, was a <NOBR>straight-bladed</NOBR> <NOBR>dagger—a</NOBR> cheap affair, sham Oriental with an embossed hilt and a tapering blade. The blade was stained with patches of what looked like rust.</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">Poirot picked it up delicately.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes,” he murmured. “There is no mistake. Here is our missing weapon all <NOBR>right—eh,</NOBR> doctor?”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">The doctor examined it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You need not be so careful,” said Poirot. “There will be no fingerprints on it save those of Mrs. Hubbard.” Constantine’s examination did not take long.</P>

<P class="p390 ft3">“It is the weapon all right,” he said. “It would account for any of the wounds.” “I implore you, my friend, do not say that!” The doctor looked astonished.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Already we are heavily overburdened by coincidence. Two people decided to stab M. Ratchett last night. It is too much of a good thing that both of them should select the same weapon.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“As, to that, the coincidence is not perhaps so great as it seems,” said the doctor. “Thousands of these sham Eastern daggers are made and shipped to the bazaars of Constantinople.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You console me a little, but only a little,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He looked thoughtfully at the door in front of him, then, lifting off the <NOBR>sponge-bag,</NOBR> he tried the handle. The door did not budge. About a foot above the handle was the door bolt. Poirot drew it back and tried again, but still the door remained fast.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“We locked it from the other side, you remember,” said the doctor.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is true,” said Poirot absently. He seemed to be thinking about something else. His brow was furrowed as though in perplexity.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It agrees, does it not?” said M. Bouc. “The man passes through this carriage. As he shuts the communicating door behind him he feels the <NOBR>sponge-bag.</NOBR> A thought comes to him and he quickly slips the <NOBR>blood-stained</NOBR> knife inside. Then, all unwitting that he has awakened Mrs. Hubbard, he slips out through the other door into the corridor.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“As you say,” murmured Poirot. “That is how it must have happened.” But the puzzled look did not leave his face.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But what is it?” demanded M. Bouc. “There is something, is there not, that does not satisfy you?”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">Poirot darted a quick took at him.</P>
<P class="p249 ft5">“The same point does not strike you? No, evidently not. Well, it is a small matter.” The conductor looked into the carriage. “The American lady is coming back.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Dr. Constantine looked rather guilty. He had, he felt, treated Mrs. Hubbard rather cavalierly. But she had no reproaches for him. Her energies were concentrated on another matter.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I’m going to say one thing right out,” she said breathlessly as she arrived in the doorway. “I’m not going on any longer in this compartment! Why, I wouldn’t sleep in it <NOBR>to-night</NOBR> if you paid me a million dollars.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But, <NOBR>Madame—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I know what you are going to say, and I’m telling you right now that I won’t do any such thing! Why, I’d rather sit up all night in the corridor.” She began to cry. “Oh, if my daughter could only <NOBR>know—if</NOBR> she could see me now, <NOBR>why—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot interrupted firmly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You misunderstand, Madame. Your demand is most reasonable. Your baggage shall be changed at once to another compartment.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Mrs. Hubbard lowered her handkerchief. “is that so? Oh! I feel better right away. But surely it’s all full, unless one of the <NOBR>gentlemen—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc spoke.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Your baggage, Madame, shall be moved out of this coach altogether. You shall have a compartment in the next coach, which was put on at Belgrade.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Why, that’s splendid. I’m not an extra nervous woman, but to sleep in that compartment next door to a dead man!” She shivered. “It would drive me plumb crazy.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Michel,” called M. Bouc. “Move this baggage into a vacant compartment in the <NOBR>Athens-Paris</NOBR> coach.”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“Yes, Monsieur. The same one as <NOBR>this—the</NOBR> No. 3?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No,” said Poirot before his friend could reply. “I think it would be better for Madame to have a different number altogether. The No. 12, for instance.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Bien, Monsieur<SPAN class="ft3">.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p391 ft5">The conductor seized the luggage. Mrs. Hubbard turned gratefully to Poirot. “That’s very kind and delicate of you. I appreciate it, I assure you.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Do not mention it, Madame. We will come with you and see you comfortably installed.” Mrs. Hubbard was escorted by the three men to her new home. She looked round her happily.</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">“This is fine.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“It suits you, Madame? It is, you see, exactly like the compartment you have left.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That’s <NOBR>so—only</NOBR> it faces the other way. But that doesn’t matter, for these trains go first one way and then the other. I said to my daughter, ‘I want a carriage facing the engine.’ and she said, ‘Why, Mamma, that’ll be no good to you, for if you go to sleep one way, when you wake up, the train’s going the other!’ And it was quite true what she said. Why, last evening we went into Belgrade one way and out the other.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“At any rate, Madame, you are quite happy and contented now?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well, no, I wouldn’t say that. Here we are stuck in a snowdrift and nobody doing anything about it, and my boat sailing the day after <NOBR>to-morrow.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Madame,” said M. Bouc, “we are all in the same <NOBR>case—every</NOBR> one of us.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, that’s true,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard. “But nobody else has had a murderer walking right through her compartment in the middle of the night.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What still puzzles me, Madame,” said Poirot, “is how the man got into your compartment if the communicating door was bolted as you say. You are sure that it <SPAN class="ft22">was </SPAN>bolted?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Why, the Swedish lady tried it before my eyes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Let us just reconstruct that little scene. You were lying in your <NOBR>bunk—so—and</NOBR> you could not see for yourself, you say?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, because of the <NOBR>sponge-bag.</NOBR> Oh! my, I shall have to get a new <NOBR>sponge-bag.</NOBR> It makes me feel sick at my stomach to look at this one.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Poirot picked up the <NOBR>sponge-bag</NOBR> and hung it on the handle of the communicating door into the next carriage.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Précisément</SPAN>. I see,” he said. “The bolt is just underneath the <NOBR>handle—the</NOBR> <NOBR>sponge-bag</NOBR> masks it. You could not see from where you were lying whether the bolt was turned or not.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Why, that’s just what I’ve been telling you!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“And the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson, stood so, between you and the door. She tried it and told you it was bolted.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That’s so.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“All the same, Madame, she may have made an error. You see what I mean.” Poirot seemed anxious to explain. “The bolt is just a projection of <NOBR>metal—so.</NOBR> When it is turned to the right, the door is locked. When it is left straight, the door is unlocked. Possibly she merely tried the door, and as it was locked on the other side she may have assumed that it was locked on your side.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Well, I guess that would be rather stupid of her.”</P>
<P class="p314 ft3">“Madame, the most kind, the most amiable, are not always the cleverest.” “That’s so, of course.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“By the way, Madame, did you travel out to Smyrna this way?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“No. I sailed right to Stamboul, and a friend of my daughter’s, Mr. Johnson (a perfectly lovely man, I’d like to have you know him), met me and showed me all round Stamboul. But it was a</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">very disappointing <NOBR>city—all</NOBR> tumbling down; and as for those mosques, and putting on those great shuffling things over your <NOBR>shoes—where</NOBR> was I?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You were saying that Mr. Johnson met you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That’s so, and he saw me on board a French Messageries boat for Smyrna, and my daughter’s husband was waiting right on the quay. What he’ll say when he hears about all this! My daughter said this would be just the safest, easiest way imaginable. ‘You just sit in your carriage,’ she said, ‘and you land right in Parrus, and there the American Express will meet you.’ And, oh, dear, what am I to do about cancelling my steamship passage? I ought to let them know. I can’t possibly make it now. This is just too <NOBR>terrible—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard showed signs of tears once more.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot, who had been fidgeting slightly, seized his opportunity.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You have had a shock, Madame. The restaurant attendant shall be instructed to bring you along some tea and some biscuits.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I don’t know that I’m so set on tea,” said Mrs. Hubbard tearfully. “That’s more an English habit.”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Coffee, then, Madame. You need some <NOBR>stimulant—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p392 ft3">“That cognac’s made my head feel mighty funny. I think I would like some coffee.” “Excellent. You must revive your forces.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“My, what a funny expression!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But first, Madame, a little matter of routine. You permit that I make a search of your baggage!”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“What for?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“We are about to commence a search of all the passengers’ luggage. I do not want to remind you of an unpleasant experience, but your <NOBR>sponge-bag—remember.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p105 ft3">“Mercy! Perhaps you’d better! I just couldn’t bear to get any more surprises of that kind.” The examination was quickly over. Mrs. Hubbard was travelling with the minimum of</P>
<P class="p106 ft3"><NOBR>luggage—a</NOBR> <NOBR>hat-box,</NOBR> a cheap suitcase, and a <NOBR>well-burdened</NOBR> travelling bag. The contents of all three were simple and straightforward, and the examination would not have taken more than a couple of minutes had not Mrs. Hubbard delayed matters by insisting on due attention being paid to photographs of “my daughter” and of two rather ugly <NOBR>children—“my</NOBR> daughter’s children. Aren’t they cunning?”</P>

<P class="p393 ft11">THE EVIDENCE OF THE PASSENGERS’ LUGGAGE</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">Having delivered himself of various polite insincerities, and having told Mrs. Hubbard that he would order coffee to be brought to her, Poirot was able to take his leave accompanied by his two friends.</P>
<P class="p394 ft3">“Well, we have made a start and drawn, a blank,” observed M. Bouc. “Whom shall we attack next?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It would be simplest, I think, just to proceed along the train, carriage by carriage. That means that we start with No. <NOBR>16—the</NOBR> amiable Mr. Hardman.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Mr. Hardman, who was smoking a cigar, welcomed them affably.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Come right in, gentlemen. That is, if it’s humanly possible. It’s just a mite cramped in here for a party.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">M. Bouc explained the object of their visit, and the big detective nodded comprehendingly. “That’s O.K. To tell the truth I’ve been wondering you didn’t get down to it sooner. Here are</P>
<P class="p106 ft5">my keys, gentlemen, and if you like to search my pockets too, why, you’re welcome. Shall I reach the grips down for you?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“The conductor will do that. Michel!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The contents of Mr. Hardman’s two “grips” were soon examined and passed. They contained, perhaps, an undue proportion of spirituous liquor. Mr. Hardman winked.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It’s not often they search your grips at the <NOBR>frontiers—not</NOBR> if you fix the conductor. I handed out a wad of Turkish notes right away, and there’s been no trouble so far.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And at Paris?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Mr. Hardman winked again. “By the time I get to Paris,” he said, “what’s left over of this little lot will go into a bottle labelled hairwash.”</P>
<P class="p395 ft5">“You are not a believer in Prohibition, Monsieur Hardman,” said M. Bouc with a smile. “Well,” said Hardman, “I can’t say Prohibition has ever worried me any.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah!” said M. Bouc. “The speakeasy.” He pronounced the word with care, savouring it. “Your American terms are so quaint, so expressive,” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Me, I would much like to go to America,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You’d learn a few <NOBR>go-ahead</NOBR> methods over there,” said Hardman. “Europe needs waking up. She’s half asleep.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is true that America is the country of progress,” agreed Poirot. “There is much that I admire about Americans. <NOBR>Only—I</NOBR> am perhaps <NOBR>old-fashioned—but</NOBR> me, I find the American women less charming than my own countrywomen. The French or the Belgian girl, coquettish, <NOBR>charming—I</NOBR> think there is no one to touch her.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Hardman turned away to peer out at the snow for a minute.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Perhaps you’re right, M. Poirot,” he said. “But I guess every nation likes its own girls best.” He blinked as though the snow hurt his eyes.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Kind of dazzling, isn’t it?” he remarked. “Say, gentlemen, this business is getting on my nerves. Murder and the snow and all. And nothing <SPAN class="ft4">doing</SPAN>. Just hanging about and killing time. I’d like to get busy after someone or something.”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“The true Western spirit of hustle,” said Poirot with a smile.</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">The conductor replaced the bags and they moved on to the next compartment. Colonel Arbuthnot was sitting in a corner smoking a pipe and reading a magazine.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot explained their errand. The Colonel made no demur. He had two heavy leather suitcases.</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“The rest of my kit has gone by long sea,” he explained.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Like most Army men the Colonel was a neat packer. The examination of his baggage took only a few minutes. Poirot noted a packet of <NOBR>pipe-cleaners.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You always use the same kind?” he asked. “Usually. If I can get ’em.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah!” Poirot nodded. These <NOBR>pipe-cleaners</NOBR> corresponded exactly with the one he had found on the floor of the dead man’s compartment.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Dr. Constantine remarked as much when they were out in the corridor again.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Tout de même</SPAN>,” murmured Poirot, “I can hardly believe it. It is not <SPAN class="ft22">dans son caractère</SPAN>, and when you have said that, you have said everything.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The door of the next compartment was closed. It was that occupied by Princess Dragomiroff. They knocked on the door and the Princess’s deep voice called “<SPAN class="ft4">Entrez</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p396 ft5">M. Bouc was spokesman. He was very deferential and polite as he explained their errand. The Princess listened to him in silence, her small <NOBR>toad-like</NOBR> face quite impassive.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“If it is necessary, Messieurs,” she said quietly when he had finished, “that is all there is to it. My maid has the keys. She will attend to it with you.”</P>
<P class="p397 ft5">“Does your maid always carry your keys, Madame?” asked Poirot. “Certainly, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And if, during the night at one of the frontiers, the customs officials should require a piece of luggage to be opened?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The old lady shrugged her shoulders. “It is very unlikely. But in such a case, the conductor would fetch her.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You trust her, then, implicitly, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I have told you so already,” said the Princess quietly. “I do not employ people whom I do not trust.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Trust is indeed something in these days. It is perhaps better to have a homely woman whom one can trust than a more <SPAN class="ft22">chic </SPAN><NOBR>maid—for</NOBR> example, some smart Parisienne.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">He saw the dark intelligent eyes come slowly round and fasten themselves upon his face. “What exactly are you implying, M. Poirot?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Nothing, Madame. I? Nothing.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But yes. You think, do you not, that I should have a smart Frenchwoman to attend to my toilet?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“It would be perhaps more usual, Madame.” She shook her head. “Schmidt is devoted to me.” Her voice dwelt lingeringly on the words. <NOBR>“Devotion—<SPAN class="ft22">c’est</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> impayable</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The German woman had arrived with the keys. The Princess spoke to her in her own language, telling her to open the valises and help the gentlemen in their search. She herself remained in the corridor looking out at the snow, and Poirot remained with her, leaving M. Bouc to the task of searching the luggage.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She regarded him with a grim smile.</P>
<P class="p284 ft3">“Well, Monsieur, do you not wish to see what my valises contain?” He shook his head. “Madame, it is a formality, that is all.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Are you so sure?”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“In your case, yes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And yet I knew and loved Sonia Armstrong. What do you think, then? That I would not soil my hands with killing such <SPAN class="ft22">canaille </SPAN>as that man Cassetti? Well, perhaps you are right.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She was silent a minute or two. Then she said:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“With such a man as that, do you know what I should have liked to do? I should have liked to call to my servants: ‘Flog this man to death and fling him out on the rubbish heap!’ That is the way things were done when I was young, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Still he did not speak, just listened attentively.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She looked at him with a sudden impetuosity. “You do not say anything, M. Poirot. What is it that you are thinking, I wonder?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He looked at her with a very direct glance. “I think, Madame, that your strength is in your <NOBR>will—not</NOBR> in your arm.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She glanced down at her thin, <NOBR>black-clad</NOBR> arms ending in those <NOBR>claw-like</NOBR> yellow hands with the rings on the fingers.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is true,” she said. “I have no strength in <NOBR>these—none.</NOBR> I do not know whether I am sorry or glad.”</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">Then she turned abruptly back towards her carriage where the maid was busily packing up the cases.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The Princess cut short M. Bouc’s apologies.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There is no need for you to apologise, Monsieur,” she said. “A murder has been committed. Certain actions have to be performed. That is all there is to it.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“</SPAN>Vous êtes bien aimable, Madame<SPAN class="ft3">.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She inclined her head slightly as they departed.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The doors of the next two carriages were shut. M. Bouc paused and scratched his head.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Diable</SPAN>!” he said. “This may be awkward. These are diplomatic passports. Their luggage is exempt.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“From customs examination, yes. But a murder is different.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I know. All the <NOBR>same—we</NOBR> do not want to have complications.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Do not distress yourself, my friend. The Count and Countess will be reasonable. See how amiable Princess Dragomiroff was about it.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“She is truly <SPAN class="ft22">grande dame</SPAN>. These two are also of the same position, but the Count impressed me as a man of somewhat truculent disposition. He was not pleased when you insisted on questioning his wife. And this will annoy him still further. <NOBR>Suppose—eh?—we</NOBR> omit them. After all, they can have nothing to do with the matter. Why should I stir up needless trouble for myself?”</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“I do not agree with you,” said Poirot. “I feel sure that Count Andrenyi will be reasonable. At any rate let us make the attempt.”</P>
<P class="p133 ft3">And before M. Bouc could reply, he rapped sharply on the door of No. 13. A voice from within cried “<SPAN class="ft22">Entrez</SPAN>!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The Count was sitting in the corner near the door reading a newspaper. The Countess was curled up in the opposite corner near the window. There was a pillow behind her head and she seemed to have been asleep.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Pardon, Monsieur le Comte,” began Poirot. “pray forgive this intrusion. It is that we are making a search of all the baggage on the train. In most cases a mere formality. But it has to be done. M. Bouc suggests that, as you have a diplomatic passport, you might reasonably claim to be exempt from such a search.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">The Count considered for a moment.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Thank you,” he said. “But I do not think that I care to have an exception made in my case. I should prefer that our baggage should be examined like that of the other passengers.”</P>
<P class="p102 ft5">He turned to his wife. “You do not object, I hope, Elena?” “Not at all,” said the Countess without hesitation.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">A rapid and somewhat perfunctory search followed. Poirot seemed to be trying to mask an embarrassment by making various small pointless remarks, such as:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Here is a label all wet on your suitcase, Madame,” as he lifted down a blue morocco case with initials on it and a coronet.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">The Countess did not reply to this observation. She seemed, indeed, rather bored by the whole proceeding, remaining curled up in her corner and staring dreamily out through the window whilst the men searched her luggage in the compartment next door.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot finished his search by opening the little cupboard above the washbasin and taking a rapid glance at its <NOBR>contents—a</NOBR> sponge, face cream, powder and a small bottle labelled trional.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Then with polite remarks on either side, the search party withdrew.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment, that of the dead man, and Poirot’s own came next.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">They now came to the <NOBR>second-class</NOBR> carriages. The first one, Nos. 10 and 11, was occupied by Mary Debenham, who was reading a book, and Greta Ohlsson, who was fast asleep but woke with a start at their entrance.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot repeated his formula. The Swedish lady seemed agitated, Mary Debenham calmly indifferent. He addressed himself to the Swedish lady.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“If you permit, Mademoiselle, we will examine your baggage first, and then perhaps you would be so good as to see how the American lady is getting on. We have moved her into one of the carriages in the next coach, but she is still very much upset as the result of her discovery. I have ordered coffee to be sent to her, but I think she is of those to whom someone to talk to is a necessity of the first order.”</P>
<P class="p124 ft3">The good lady was instantly sympathetic. She would go immediately. It must have been indeed a terrible shock to the nerves, and already the poor lady was upset by the journey and leaving her daughter. Ah, yes, certainly she would go at <NOBR>once—her</NOBR> case was not <NOBR>locked—and</NOBR> she would take with her some sal ammoniac.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She bustled off. Her possessions were soon examined. They were meagre in the extreme. She had evidently not yet noticed the missing wires from the <NOBR>hat-box.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Miss Debenham had put her book down. She was watching Poirot. When he asked her, she handed over her keys. Then, as he lifted down a case and opened it, she said:</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Why did you send her away, M. Poirot?”</P>
<P class="p398 ft5">“I, Mademoiselle! Why, to minister to the American lady.” “An excellent <NOBR>pretext—but</NOBR> a pretext all the same.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I don’t understand you, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“I think you understand me very well.” She smiled. “You wanted to get me alone. Wasn’t that it?”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“You are putting words into my mouth, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“And ideas into your head? No, I don’t think so. The ideas are already there. That is right, isn’t it?”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Mademoiselle, we have a <NOBR>proverb—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Qui s’excuse </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">s’accuse</SPAN>—is</NOBR> that what you were going to say? You must give me the credit for a certain amount of observation and common sense. For some reason or other you have got it</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">into your head that I know something about this sordid <NOBR>business—this</NOBR> murder of a man I never saw before.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You are imagining things, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, I am not imagining things at all. But it seems to me that a lot of time is wasted by not speaking the <NOBR>truth—by</NOBR> beating about the bush instead of coming straight out with things.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“And you do not like the waste of time. No, you like to come straight to the point. You like the direct method. <SPAN class="ft4">Eh bien</SPAN>, I will give it to you, the direct method. I will ask you the meaning of certain words that I overheard on the journey from Syria. I had got out of the train to do what the English call ‘stretch the legs’ at the station of Konya. Your voice and the Colonel’s, Mademoiselle, they came to me out of the night. You said to him, ‘<SPAN class="ft4">Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us</SPAN>.’ What <SPAN class="ft4">did </SPAN>you mean by those words, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p399 ft3">She asked very quietly, “Do you think I <NOBR>meant—murder?”</NOBR> “It is I who am asking you, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She <NOBR>sighed—was</NOBR> lost a minute in thought. Then, as though rousing herself, she said:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Those words had a meaning, Monsieur, but not one that I can tell you. I can only give you my solemn word of honour that I had never set eyes on this man Ratchett in my life until I saw him on this train.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3"><NOBR>“And—you</NOBR> refuse to explain those words?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes, if you like to put it that <NOBR>way—I</NOBR> refuse. They had to do <NOBR>with—with</NOBR> a task I had undertaken.”</P>
<P class="p400 ft3">“A task that is now ended?” “What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p401 ft3">“It is ended, is it not?” “Why should you think so?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Listen, Mademoiselle, I will recall to you another incident. There was a delay to the train on the day we were to reach Stamboul. You were very agitated, Mademoiselle. You, so calm, so <NOBR>self-controlled.</NOBR> You lost that calm.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I did not want to miss my connection.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“So you said. But, Mademoiselle, the Orient Express leaves Stamboul every day of the week. Even if you had missed the connection it would only have been a matter of <NOBR>twenty-four</NOBR> hours’ delay.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Miss Debenham for the first time showed signs of losing her temper.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You do not seem to realise that one may have friends awaiting one’s arrival in London, and that a day’s delay upsets arrangements and causes a lot of annoyance.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Ah, it is like that? There are friends awaiting your arrival? You do not want to cause them inconvenience?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Naturally.”</P>
<P class="p402 ft5">“And <NOBR>yet—it</NOBR> is <NOBR>curious—”</NOBR> “What is curious?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“On this <NOBR>train—again</NOBR> we have a delay. And this time a more serious delay, since there is no possibility of sending a telegram to your friends or of getting them on the <NOBR>long—the</NOBR> <NOBR>long—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Long distance? The telephone, you mean.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Ah, yes, the portmanteau call, as you say in England.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Mary Debenham smiled a little in spite of herself. “Trunk call,” she corrected. “Yes, as you say, it is extremely annoying not to be able to get any word through, either by telephone or by telegraph.”</P>

<P class="p403 ft23">“And yet, Mademoiselle, <SPAN class="ft24">this </SPAN>time your manner is quite different. You no longer betray the impatience. You are calm and philosophical.”</P>
<P class="p404 ft5">Mary Debenham flushed and bit her lip. She no longer felt inclined to smile. “You do not answer, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p76 ft3">“I am sorry. I did not know that there was anything to answer.” “Your change of attitude, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p318 ft5">“Don’t you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing, M. Poirot?” Poirot spread out his hands in an apologetic gesture.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It is perhaps a fault with us detectives. We expect the behaviour to be always consistent. We do not allow for changes of mood.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Mary Debenham made no reply.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You know Colonel Arbuthnot well, Mademoiselle?”</P>
<P class="p134 ft5">He fancied that she was relieved by the change of subject. “I met him for the first time on this journey.”</P>
<P class="p152 ft3">“Have you any reason to suspect that he may have known this man Ratchett?” She shook her head decisively. “I am quite sure he didn’t.”</P>
<P class="p405 ft5">“Why are you sure?” “By the way he spoke.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“And yet, Mademoiselle, we found a <NOBR>pipe-cleaner</NOBR> on the floor of the dead man’s compartment. And Colonel Arbuthnot is the only man on the train who smokes a pipe.”</P>
<P class="p105 ft3">He watched her narrowly, but she displayed neither surprise nor emotion, merely said: “Nonsense. It’s absurd. Colonel Arbuthnot is the last man in the world to be mixed up in a</P>
<P class="p6 ft3"><NOBR>crime—especially</NOBR> a theatrical kind of crime like this.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">It was so much what Poirot himself thought that he found himself on the point of agreeing with her. He said instead:</P>
<P class="p406 ft5">“I must remind you that you do not know him very well, Mademoiselle.” She shrugged her shoulders. “I know the type well enough.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He said very gently:</P>
<P class="p407 ft5">“You still refuse to tell me the meaning of those words: ‘When it’s behind us’?” She replied coldly, “I have nothing more to say.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It does not matter,” said Hercule Poirot. “I shall find out.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He bowed and left the compartment, closing the door after him.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Was that wise, my friend?” asked M. Bouc. “You have put her on her <NOBR>guard—and</NOBR> through her, you have put the Colonel on his guard also.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mon ami</SPAN>, if you wish to catch a rabbit you put a ferret into the hole, and if the rabbit is <NOBR>there—he</NOBR> runs. That is all I have done.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">They entered the compartment of Hildegarde Schmidt.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The woman was standing in readiness, her face respectful but unemotional.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Poirot took a quick glance through the contents of the small case on the seat. Then he motioned to the attendant to get down the bigger suitcase from the rack.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“The keys?” he said.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“It is not locked, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot undid the hasps and lifted the lid.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Aha!” he said, and turning to M. Bouc, “You remember what I said? Look here a little moment!”</P>
<P class="p72 ft22">On the top of the suitcase was a hastily <NOBR>rolled-up</NOBR> brown Wagon Lit uniform<SPAN class="ft3">.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p65 ft3">The stolidity of the German woman underwent a sudden change.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Ach</SPAN>!” she cried. “That is not mine. I did not put it there. I have never looked in that case since we left Stamboul. Indeed, indeed, it is true!” She looked from one to another of the men pleadingly.</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">Poirot took her gently by the arm and soothed her.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, no, all is well. We believe you. Do not be agitated. I am sure you did not hide the uniform there as I am sure that you are a good cook. See. You <SPAN class="ft22">are </SPAN>a good cook, are you not?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Bewildered, the woman smiled in spite of herself, “Yes, indeed, all my ladies have said so. <NOBR>I—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p110 ft3">She stopped, her mouth open, looking frightened again.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, no,” said Poirot. “I assure you all is well. See, I will tell you how this happened. This man, the man you saw in Wagon Lit uniform, comes out of the dead man’s compartment. He collides with you. That is bad luck for him. He has hoped that no one will see him. What to do next? He must get rid of his uniform. It is now not a safeguard, but a danger.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">His glance went to M. Bow and Dr. Constantine, who were listening attentively.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There is the snow, you see. The snow which confuses all his plans. Where can he hide these clothes? All the compartments are full. No, he passes one whose door is open, showing it to be unoccupied. It must be the one belonging to the woman with whom he has just collided. He slips in, removes the uniform and jams it hurriedly into a suitcase on the rack. It may be some time before it is discovered.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And then?” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That we must discuss,” Poirot said with a warning glance.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He held up the tunic. A button, the third down, was missing. Poirot slipped his hand into the pocket and took out a conductor’s <NOBR>pass-key,</NOBR> used to unlock the doors of the compartments.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Here is the explanation of how one man was able to pass through locked doors,” said M. Bouc. “Your questions to Mrs. Hubbard were unnecessary. Locked or not locked, the man could easily get through the communicating door. After all, if a Wagon Lit uniform, why not a Wagon Lit key?”</P>
<P class="p153 ft3">“Why not indeed?” returned Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“We might have known it, really. You remember that Michel said that the door into the corridor of Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment was locked when he came in answer to her bell.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That is so, Monsieur,” said the conductor. “That is why I thought the lady must have been dreaming.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“But now it is easy,” continued M. Bouc. “Doubtless he meant to relock the communicating door, also, but perhaps he heard some movement from the bed and it startled him.”</P>
<P class="p408 ft5">“We have now,” said Poirot, “only to find the scarlet kimono.” “True. And these last two compartments are occupied by men.” “We will search all the same.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Oh! assuredly. Besides, I remember what you said.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Hector MacQueen acquiesced willingly in the search. “I’d just as soon you did,” he said with a rueful smile. “I feel I’m definitely the most suspicious character on the train. You’ve only got to find a will in which the old man left me all his money, and that’ll just about fix things.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“That’s only my fun,” added MacQueen hastily. “He’d never have left me a cent, really. I was just useful to <NOBR>him—languages</NOBR> and so on. You’re likely to be out of luck, you know, if you don’t</P>

<P class="p4 ft3">His voice was a little louder than usual. It was as though he were slightly uneasy over the search in spite of his expressed willingness.</P>
<P class="p133 ft5">Poirot emerged. “Nothing,” he said. “Not even a compromising bequest!” MacQueen sighed. “Well, that’s a load off my mind,” he said humorously.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">They moved on to the last compartment. The examination of the luggage of the big Italian and of the valet yielded no result.</P>
<P class="p409 ft5">The three men stood at the end of the coach looking at each other. “What next?” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“We will go back to the <NOBR>dining-car,”</NOBR> said Poirot. “We know now all that we can know. We have the evidence of the passengers, the evidence of their baggage, the evidence of our eyes. ...</P>
<P class="p410 ft3">We can expect no further help. It must be our part now to use our brains.” He felt in his pocket for his cigarette case. It was empty.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I will join you in a moment,” he said. “I shall need the cigarettes. This is a very difficult, a very curious, affair. Who wore that scarlet kimono? Where is it now? I wish I knew. There is something in this <NOBR>case—some</NOBR> <NOBR>factor—that</NOBR> escapes me! It is difficult because it has been <SPAN class="ft4">made </SPAN>difficult. But we will discuss it. Pardon me a moment.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He went hurriedly along the corridor to his own compartment. He had, he knew, a further supply of cigarettes in one of his valises.</P>
<P class="p349 ft5">He got it down and snapped back the lock. Then he sat back on his heels and stared.</P>
<P class="p411 ft24">Neatly folded on the top of the case was a thin scarlet silk kimono embroidered with dragons. <SPAN class="ft23">“So,” he murmured. “It is like that. A defiance. Very well, I take it up.”</SPAN></P>

<P class="p414 ft11">WHICH OF THEM?</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">M. Bouc. and Dr. Constantine were talking together when Poirot entered the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> M. Bouc was looking depressed.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Le voilà</SPAN>,” said the latter when he saw Poirot. Then he added, as his friend sat down, “If you solve this case, <SPAN class="ft4">mon cher</SPAN>, I shall indeed believe in miracles!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It worries you, this case?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Naturally it worries me. I cannot make head or tail of it.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I agree,” said the doctor. He looked at Poirot with interest. “To be frank,” he said, “I cannot see what you are going to do next.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No!” said Poirot thoughtfully.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He took out his cigarette case and lit one of his tiny cigarettes. His eyes were dreamy.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That, to me, is the interest of this case,” he said. “We are cut off from all the normal routes of procedure. Are these people whose evidence we have taken speaking the truth, or lying? We have no means of finding <NOBR>out—except</NOBR> such means as we can devise ourselves. It is an exercise, this, of the brain.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is all very fine,” said M. Bouc. “But what have you to go upon?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I told you just now. We have the evidence of the passengers and the evidence of our own eyes.”</P>
<P class="p415 ft3">“Pretty <NOBR>evidence—that</NOBR> of the passengers! It told us just nothing at all.” Poirot shook his head.</P>
<P class="p411 ft3">“I do not agree, my friend. The evidence of the passengers gave us several points of interest.” “Indeed,” said M. Bouc sceptically. “I did not observe it.”</P>
<P class="p375 ft5">“That is because you did not listen.” “Well, tell me, what did I miss?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I will just take one <NOBR>instance—the</NOBR> first evidence we heard, that of the young MacQueen. He uttered, to my mind, one very significant phrase.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“About the letters?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, not about the letters. As far as I can remember, his words were: ‘<SPAN class="ft4">We travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than a secretary</SPAN>.’ ”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He looked from the doctor’s face to that of M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What? You still do not see? That is <NOBR>inexcusable—for</NOBR> you had a second chance again just now when he said, ‘<SPAN class="ft22">You’re likely to be out of luck if you don’t speak anything but good American</SPAN>.’ ”</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“You <NOBR>mean—?”</NOBR> M. Bouc still looked puzzled.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p99 ft3">“Ah, it is that you want it given to you in words of one syllable. Well, here it is! <SPAN class="ft22">M. Ratchett spoke no French</SPAN>. Yet, when the conductor came in answer to his bell last night, it was a voice speaking in <SPAN class="ft22">French </SPAN>that told him that it was a mistake and that he was not wanted. It was, moreover, a perfectly idiomatic phrase that was used, not one that a man knowing only a few words of French would have selected. ‘<SPAN class="ft22">Ce n’est rien Je me suis trompé</SPAN>.’ ”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is true,” cried Constantine excitedly. “We should have seen that! I remember your laying stress on the words when you repeated them to us. Now I understand your reluctance to rely upon the evidence of the dented watch. Already, at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one, Ratchett was <NOBR>dead—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p416 ft23">“And it was his murderer speaking!” finished M. Bouc impressively. Poirot raised a deprecating hand.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Let us not go too fast. And do not let us assume more than we actually know. It is safe, I think, to say that at that <NOBR>time—twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to <NOBR>one—<SPAN class="ft22">some</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> other person </SPAN>was in Ratchett’s compartment, and that that person either was French or could speak the French language fluently.”</P>
<P class="p385 ft3">“You are very cautious, <SPAN class="ft22">mon </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">vieux</SPAN>—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p100 ft3">“One should advance only a step at a time. We have no actual <SPAN class="ft22">evidence </SPAN>that Ratchett was dead at that time.”</P>
<P class="p417 ft5">“There is the cry that awakened you.” “Yes, that is true.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“In one way,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully, “this discovery does not affect things very much. You heard someone moving about next door. That someone was not Ratchett, but the other man. Doubtless he is washing blood from his hands, clearing up after the crime, burning the incriminating letter. Then he waits till all is still, and, when he thinks it is safe and the coast is clear, he locks and chains Ratchett’s door on the inside, unlocks the communicating door through into Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment and slips out that way. In fact, it is exactly as we thought, <SPAN class="ft22">with the difference that Ratchett was killed about half an hour earlier </SPAN>and the watch put on to a quarter past one to create an alibi.”</P>
<P class="p124 ft3">“Not such a famous alibi,” said Poirot. “The hands of the watch pointed to <NOBR>1.15—the</NOBR> exact time when the intruder actually left the scene of the crime.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“True,” said M. Bouc, a little confused. “What then does the watch convey to you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“If the hands were <NOBR>altered—I</NOBR> say <NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">if</SPAN>—then</NOBR> the time at which they were set <SPAN class="ft4">must </SPAN>have a significance. The natural reaction would be to suspect anyone who had a reliable alibi for the time <NOBR>indicated—in</NOBR> this case, 1.15.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, yes,” said the doctor. “That reasoning is good.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“We must also pay a little attention to the time the intruder <SPAN class="ft22">entered </SPAN>the compartment. When had he an opportunity of doing so? Unless we are to assume the complicity of the real conductor, there was only one time when he could have done <NOBR>so—during</NOBR> the time the train stopped at Vincovci. After the train left Vincovci the conductor was sitting facing the corridor, and whereas any one of the passengers would pay little attention to a Wagon Lit attendant, the <SPAN class="ft22">one </SPAN>person who <SPAN class="ft22">would </SPAN>notice an impostor is the real conductor. But during the halt at Vincovci the conductor is out on the platform. The coast is clear.”</P>
<P class="p124 ft23">“And by our former reasoning, it <SPAN class="ft24">must </SPAN>be one of the passengers,” said M. Bouc. “We come back to where we were. Which of them?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Poirot smiled.</P>

<P class="p438 ft11">TEN QUESTIONS</P>
<P class="p439 ft3">On the paper was written:</P>
<P class="p440 ft3">THINGS NEEDING EXPLANATION</P>
<P class="p441 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">The handkerchief marked with the initial H. Whose is it?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">The </SPAN><NOBR>pipe-cleaner.</NOBR> Was it dropped by Colonel Arbuthnot? Or by someone else?</P>
<P class="p442 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Who wore the scarlet kimono?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft5"><SPAN class="ft5">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft30">Who was the man or woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft5"><SPAN class="ft5">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft30">Why do the hands of the watch point to 1.15?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Was the murder committed at that time?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft5"><SPAN class="ft5">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft30">Was it earlier?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Was it later?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft5"><SPAN class="ft5">9.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft30">Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more than one person?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p442 ft3"><SPAN class="ft3">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft28">What other explanation of his wounds can there be?</SPAN></P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“Well, let us see what we can do,” said M. Bouc, brightening a little at this challenge to his wits. The handkerchief, to begin with. Let us by all means be orderly and methodical.”</P>
<P class="p443 ft5">“Assuredly,” said Poirot, nodding his head in a satisfied fashion. M. Bouc continued somewhat didactically.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The initial H is connected with three <NOBR>people—Mrs.</NOBR> Hubbard, Miss Debenham, whose second name is Hermione, and the maid Hildegarde Schmidt.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Ah! And of those three?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It is difficult to say. But I <SPAN class="ft22">think </SPAN>I should vote for Miss Debenham. For all one knows she may be called by her second name and not her first. Also there is already some suspicion attaching to her. That conversation you overheard, <SPAN class="ft22">mon cher</SPAN>, was certainly a little curious, and so is her refusal to explain it.”</P>
<P class="p124 ft23">“As for me, I plump for the American,” said Dr. Constantine. “It is a very expensive handkerchief, that; and Americans, as all the world knows, do not care what they pay.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“So you both eliminate the maid?” asked Poirot.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes. As she herself said, it is the handkerchief of a member of the upper classes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">And the second <NOBR>question—the</NOBR> <NOBR>pipe-cleaner.</NOBR> Did Colonel Arbuthnot drop it, or somebody else?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“That is more difficult. The English, they do not stab. You are right there. I incline to the view that someone else dropped the <NOBR>pipe-cleaner—and</NOBR> did so to incriminate the <NOBR>long-legged</NOBR> Englishman.”</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“As you said, M. Poirot,” put in the doctor, “<SPAN class="ft22">two </SPAN>clues is too much carelessness. I agree with M. Bouc. The handkerchief was a genuine <NOBR>oversight—hence</NOBR> none of the women will admit that it is hers. The <NOBR>pipe-cleaner</NOBR> is a faked clue. In support of that theory, you notice that Colonel Arbuthnot shows no embarrassment and admits freely to smoking a pipe and using that type of cleaner.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">“You reason well,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Question No. <NOBR>3—Who</NOBR> wore the scarlet kimono!” went on M. Bouc. “As to that, I will confess I have not the slightest idea. Have you any views on the subject, Dr. Constantine?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“None.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Then we confess ourselves beaten there. The next question has, at any rate, possibilities. Who was the man or the woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform? Well, one can list with certainty a number of people that it could not have been. Hardman, Colonel Arbuthnot, Foscarelli, Count Andrenyi and Hector MacQueen are all too tall. Mrs. Hubbard, Hildegarde Schmidt and Greta Ohlsson are too broad. That leaves the valet, Miss Debenham, Princess Dragomiroff and Countess <NOBR>Andrenyi—and</NOBR> none of them sounds likely! Greta Ohlsson in one case, and Antonio Foscarelli in the other, both swear that Miss Debenham and the valet never left their compartments. Hildegarde Schmidt swears that the Princess was in hers, and Count Andrenyi has told us that his wife took a sleeping draught. Therefore it seems impossible that it can be <NOBR>anybody—which</NOBR> is absurd!”</P>
<P class="p444 ft3">“As our old friend Euclid says,” murmured Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It must be one of those four,” said Dr. Constantine. “Unless it is someone from outside who has found a <NOBR>hiding-place—and</NOBR> that we agreed was impossible.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc had passed on to the next question on the list.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No. <NOBR>5—Why</NOBR> do the hands of the broken watch point to 1.15? I can see two explanations of that. Either it was done by the murderer to establish an alibi, and afterwards, when he meant to leave the compartment, he was prevented by hearing people moving about; or <NOBR>else—wait—I</NOBR> have an idea <NOBR>coming—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p154 ft3">The other two waited respectfully while M. Bouc struggled in mental agony.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I have it,” he said at last. “It was not the Wagon Lit murderer who tampered with the watch! It was the person we have called the Second <NOBR>Murderer—the</NOBR> <NOBR>left-handed</NOBR> <NOBR>person—in</NOBR> other words the woman in the scarlet kimono. She arrives later and moves back the hands of the watch in order to make an alibi for herself.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Bravo said Dr. Constantine. “It is well imagined, that.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“In fact,” said Poirot, “she stabbed him in the dark, not realizing that he was dead already, but somehow deduced that he had a watch in his pyjama pocket, took it out, put back the hands blindly, and gave it the requisite dent.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc looked at him coldly. “Have you anything better to suggest, yourself?” he asked. “At the <NOBR>moment—no,”</NOBR> admitted Poirot. “All the same,” he went on, “I do not think you have either of you appreciated the most interesting point about that watch.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Does question No. 6 deal with it?” asked the doctor. “To that <NOBR>question—Was</NOBR> the murder committed at that time, <NOBR>1.15?—I</NOBR> answer <SPAN class="ft22">No</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I agree,” said M. Bouc. “’Was it earlier?’ is the next question. I <NOBR>say—Yes!</NOBR> You, too, doctor?”</P>
<P class="p63 ft5">The doctor nodded. “Yes, but the question ‘Was it later?’ can also be answered in the affirmative. I agree with your theory, M. Bouc, and so, I think, does M. Poirot, although he does not wish to commit himself. The First Murderer came earlier than 1. 15, but the Second Murderer came <SPAN class="ft4">after </SPAN>1.15. And as regards the question of <NOBR>left-handedness,</NOBR> ought we not to take steps to ascertain which of the passengers is <NOBR>left-handed?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p64 ft3">“I have not completely neglected that point,” said Poirot. “You may have noticed that I made each passenger write either a signature or an address. That is not conclusive, because some people do certain actions with the right hand and others with the left. Some write <NOBR>right-handed,</NOBR></P>

<P class="p197 ft3">but play golf <NOBR>left-handed.</NOBR> Still, it is something. Every person questioned took the pen in his or her right <NOBR>hand—with</NOBR> the exception of Princess Dragomiroff, who refused to write.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Princess <NOBR>Dragomiroff—impossible,”</NOBR> said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I doubt if she would have had the strength to inflict that <NOBR>left-handed</NOBR> blow,” said Dr. Constantine dubiously. ‘That particular wound had been inflicted with considerable force.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“More force than a woman could use?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, I would not say that. But I think more force than an elderly woman could display, and Princess Dragomiroff’s physique is particularly frail.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“It might be a question of the influence of mind over body,” said Poirot. “Princess Dragomiroff has great personality and immense <NOBR>will-power.</NOBR> But let us pass from that for the moment.”</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“To questions Nos. 9 and 10? Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more than one person, and what other explanation of the wounds can there be? In my opinion, medically speaking, there can be <SPAN class="ft22">no other </SPAN>explanation of those wounds. To suggest that one man struck first feebly and then with violence, first with the right hand and then with the left, and after an interval of perhaps half an hour inflicted fresh wounds on a dead <NOBR>body—well,</NOBR> it does not make sense.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“No,” said Poirot. “It does not make sense. And you think that two murderers do make sense?”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“As you yourself have said, what other explanation can there be?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot stared straight ahead of him. “That is what I ask myself,” he said. “That is what I never cease to ask myself.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He leaned back in his seat.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“From now on, it is all here.” He tapped himself on the forehead. “We have thrashed it all out. The facts are all in front of <NOBR>us—neatly</NOBR> arranged with order and method. The passengers have sat here, one by one, giving their evidence. We know all that can be <NOBR>known—<SPAN class="ft4">from</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> outside </SPAN>...</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He gave M. Bouc an affectionate smile.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It has been a little joke between us, has it <NOBR>not—this</NOBR> business of sitting back and <SPAN class="ft4">thinking </SPAN>out the truth? Well, I am about to put my theory into <NOBR>practice—here</NOBR> before your eyes. You two must do the same. Let us all three close our eyes and <SPAN class="ft4">think</SPAN>. ...</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“One or more of those passengers killed Ratchett. <SPAN class="ft22">Which of them</SPAN>?”</P>

<P class="p88 ft21">3</P>
<P class="p238 ft11">CERTAIN SUGGESTIVE POINTS</P>
<P class="p202 ft3">It was quite a quarter of an hour before anyone spoke.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine had started by trying to obey Poirot’s instructions. They had endeavoured to see through a maze of conflicting particulars to a clear and outstanding solution.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">M. Bouc’s thoughts had run something as follows:</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Assuredly I must think. But as far as that goes I have already thought. ... Poirot obviously thinks that this English girl is mixed up in the matter. I cannot help feeling that that is most unlikely. ... The English are extremely cold. Probably it is because they have no figures. ... But that is not the point. It seems that the Italian could not have done <NOBR>it—a</NOBR> pity. I suppose the English valet is not lying when he said the other never left the compartment? But why should he! It is not easy to bribe the English; they are so unapproachable. The whole thing is most unfortunate. I wonder when we shall get out of this. There must be <SPAN class="ft22">some </SPAN>rescue work in progress. They are so slow in these countries ... it is hours before anyone thinks of doing anything. And the police of these countries, they will be most trying to deal <NOBR>with—puffed</NOBR> up with importance, touchy, on their dignity. They will make a grand affair of all this. It is not often that such a chance comes their way. It will be in all the newspapers. ...”</P>
<P class="p203 ft3">And from there on, M. Bouc’s thoughts went along a <NOBR>well-worn</NOBR> course which they had already traversed some hundred times.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Dr. Constantine’s thoughts ran thus:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“He is queer, this little man. A genius? Or a crank? Will he solve this mystery? <NOBR>Impossible—I</NOBR> can see no way out of it. It is all too confusing. ... Everyone is lying, perhaps. ... But even then, that does not help one. If they are all lying, it is just as confusing as if they were speaking the truth. Odd about those wounds. I cannot understand it. ... It would be easier to understand if he had been <NOBR>shot—after</NOBR> all, the term ‘gunman’ must mean that they shoot with a gun. A curious country, America. I should like to go there. It is so progressive. When I get home I must get hold of Demetrius <NOBR>Zagone—he</NOBR> has been to America, he has all the modern ideas. ... I wonder what Zia is doing at this moment. If my wife ever finds <NOBR>out—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p154 ft3">His thoughts went on to entirely private matters. ...</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Hercule Poirot sat very still.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">One might have thought he was asleep.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">And then, suddenly, after a quarter of an hour’s complete immobility his eyebrows began to move slowly up his forehead. A little sigh escaped him. He murmured beneath his breath.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“But after all, why not? And if <NOBR>so—why,</NOBR> if so, that would explain everything.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">His eyes opened. They were green like a cat’s. He said softly: “<SPAN class="ft22">Eh bien</SPAN>. I have thought. And you?”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">Lost in their reflections, both men started violently.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I have thought also,” said M. Bouc, just a shade guiltily. “But I have arrived at no conclusion. The elucidation of crime is your <SPAN class="ft22">métier</SPAN>, not mine, my friend.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I, too, have reflected with great earnestness,” said the doctor, unblushingly recalling his thoughts from certain pornographic details. “I have thought of many possible theories, but not one that really satisfies me.”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p65 ft3">Poirot nodded amiably. His nod seemed to say:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Quite right. That is the proper thing to say. You have given me the cue I expected.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He sat very upright, threw out his chest, caressed his moustache and spoke in the manner of a practised speaker addressing a public meeting.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“My friends, I have reviewed the facts in my mind, and have also gone over to myself the evidence of the <NOBR>passengers—with</NOBR> this result: I see, nebulously as yet, a certain explanation that would cover the facts as we know them. It is a very curious explanation, and I cannot be sure as yet that it is the true one. To find out definitely I shall have to make certain experiments.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I would like first to mention certain points which appear to me suggestive. Let us start with a remark made to me by M. Bouc in this very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on the train. He commented on the fact that we were surrounded by people of all classes, of all ages, of all nationalities. That is a fact somewhat rare at this time of year. The <NOBR>Athens-Paris</NOBR> and the <NOBR>Bucharest-Paris</NOBR> coaches, for instance, are almost empty. Remember also, the passenger who failed to turn up. He is, I think, significant. Then there are some minor points that strike me as <NOBR>suggestive—for</NOBR> instance, the position of Mrs. Hubbard’s <NOBR>sponge-bag,</NOBR> the name of Mrs. Armstrong’s mother, the detective methods of M. Hardman, the suggestion of M. MacQueen that Ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we found, Princess Dragomiroff’s Christian name, and a grease spot on a Hungarian passport.”</P>
<P class="p101 ft3">The two men stared at him.</P>
<P class="p445 ft3">“Do they suggest anything to you, those points?” asked Poirot. “Not a thing,” said M. Bouc frankly.</P>
<P class="p5 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“And </SPAN>M. le docteur<SPAN class="ft3">?”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not understand in the least what you are talking of.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc, meanwhile, seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had mentioned, was sorting through the passports. With a grunt he picked up that of Count and Countess Andrenyi and opened it.</P>
<P class="p153 ft3">“Is this what you mean? This dirty mark?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes. It is a fairly fresh grease spot. You notice where it occurs?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“At the beginning of the description of the Count’s <NOBR>wife—her</NOBR> Christian name, to be exact. But I confess that I still do not see the point.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I am going to approach it from another angle. Let us go back to the handkerchief found at the scene of the crime. As we stated not long ago, three people are associated with the letter H: Mrs. Hubbard, Miss Debenham and the maid, Hildegarde Schmidt. Now let us regard that handkerchief from another point of view. It is, my friends, an extremely expensive <NOBR>handkerchief—an</NOBR> <SPAN class="ft22">objet de luxe</SPAN>, <NOBR>hand-made,</NOBR> embroidered in Paris. Which of the passengers, apart from the initial, was likely to own such a handkerchief? Not Mrs. Hubbard, a worthy woman with no pretensions to reckless extravagance in dress. Not Miss <NOBR>Debenham—that</NOBR> class of Englishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief, not an expensive wisp of cambric costing perhaps two hundred francs. And certainly not the maid. But there <SPAN class="ft22">are </SPAN>two women on the tram who would be likely to own such a handkerchief. Let us see if we can connect them in any way with the letter H. The two women I refer to are Princess <NOBR>Dragomiroff—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p444 ft3">“Whose Christian name is Natalia,” put in M. Bouc ironically.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Exactly. And her Christian name, as I said just now, is decidedly suggestive. The other woman is Countess Andrenyi. And at once something strikes <NOBR>us—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">You</SPAN>!”</P>

<P class="p99 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Me</SPAN>, then. Her Christian name on her passport is disfigured by a blob of grease. just an accident, anyone would say. But consider that Christian name. Elena. Suppose that, instead of Elena, it were <SPAN class="ft22">Helena</SPAN>. That capital H could be turned into a capital E and then run over the small <SPAN class="ft22">e </SPAN>next to it quite <NOBR>easily—and</NOBR> then a spot of grease dropped to cover up the alteration.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Helena!” cried M. Bouc. “It is an idea, that.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Certainly it is an idea! I look about for any confirmation, however slight, of my <NOBR>idea—and</NOBR> I find it. One of the luggage labels on the Countess’s baggage is slightly damp. It is one that happens to run over the first initial on top of the case. That label has been soaked off and put on again in a different place.”</P>
<P class="p153 ft3">“You begin to convince me,” said M. Bouc. “But the Countess <NOBR>Andrenyi—surely—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Ah, now, <SPAN class="ft22">mon vieux</SPAN>, you must turn yourself round and approach an entirely different angle of the case. How was this murder intended to appear to everybody? Do not forget that the snow has upset all the murderer’s original plan. Let us imagine, for a little minute, that there is no snow, that the train proceeded on its normal course. What, then, would have happened?</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“The murder, let us say, would still have been discovered in all probability at the Italian frontier early this morning. Much of the same evidence would have been given to the Italian police. The threatening letters would have been produced by M. MacQueen; M. Hardman would have told his story; Mrs. Hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her compartment; the button would have been found. I imagine that two things only would have been different. The man would have passed through Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment just before one <NOBR>o’clock—and</NOBR> the Wagon Lit uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You mean?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I mean that the murder was <SPAN class="ft22">planned to look like an outside job</SPAN>. It would have been presumed that the assassin had left the train at Brod where it is timed to arrive at 0.58. Somebody would probably have passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in the corridor. The uniform would be left in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played. No suspicion would have attached to the passengers. That, my friends, was how the affair was intended to appear to the outside world.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“But the accident to the train changes everything. Doubtless we have here the reason why the man remained in the compartment with his victim so long. He was waiting for the train to go on. But at last he realised that <SPAN class="ft22">the train was not going on</SPAN>. Different plans would have to be made. The murderer would now be <SPAN class="ft22">known </SPAN>to be still on the train.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Yes, yes,” said M. Bouc impatiently. “I see all that. But where does the handkerchief come in?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“I am returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route. To begin with, you must realise that the threatening letters were in the nature of a blind. They might have been lifted bodily out of an indifferently written American crime novel. They are not <SPAN class="ft22">real</SPAN>. They are, in fact, simply intended for the police. What we have to ask ourselves is: ‘Did they deceive Ratchett?’ On the face of it, the answer seems to be No. His instructions to Hardman seem to point to a definite ‘private’ enemy, of whose identity he was well aware. That is, if we accept Hardman’s story as true. But Ratchett certainly received <SPAN class="ft22">one </SPAN>letter of a very different <NOBR>character—the</NOBR> one containing a reference to the Armstrong baby, a fragment of which we found in his compartment. In case Ratchett had not realised it sooner, this was to make sure that he understood the reason of the threats against his life. That letter, as I have said all along, was <SPAN class="ft22">not </SPAN>intended to be found. The murderer’s first care was to destroy it. This, then, was the second hitch in his plans. The first was the snow, the second was our reconstruction of that fragment.</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p77 ft3">“That the note was destroyed so carefully can mean only one thing. <SPAN class="ft22">There must be on the train someone so intimately connected with the Armstrong family that the finding of that note would immediately direct suspicion upon that person.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now we come to the other two clues that we found. I pass over the <NOBR>pipe-cleaner.</NOBR> We have already said a good deal about that. Let us pass on to the handkerchief. Taken at its simplest it is a clue which directly incriminates someone whose initial is H, and it was dropped there unwittingly by that person.”</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“Exactly,” said Dr. Constantine. “She finds out that she has dropped the handkerchief and immediately takes steps to conceal her Christian name.”</P>
<P class="p446 ft3">“How fast you go! You arrive at a conclusion much sooner than I would permit myself to do.” “Is there any other alternative?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">‘Certainly there is. Suppose, for instance, that you have committed a crime and wish to cast the blame for it on someone else. Well, there is on the train a certain person connected intimately with the Armstrong <NOBR>family—a</NOBR> woman. Suppose, then, that you leave there a handkerchief belonging to that woman. She will be questioned, her connection with the Armstrong family will be brought <NOBR>out—<SPAN class="ft4">et</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> voilà</SPAN>: <NOBR>motive—<SPAN class="ft4">and</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> </SPAN>an incriminating article of evidence.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But in such a case,” objected the doctor, “the person indicated, being innocent, would not take steps to conceal her identity.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ah, really? That is what you think? That is, truly, the opinion of the police court. But I know human nature, my friend, and I tell you that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for murder, the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most absurd things. No, no, the grease spot and the changed label do not prove <NOBR>guilt—they</NOBR> only prove that the Countess Andrenyi is anxious for some reason to conceal her identity.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What do you think her connection with the Armstrong family can be? She has never been in America, she says.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Exactly, and she speaks English with a foreign accent, and she has a very foreign appearance which she exaggerates. But it should not be difficult to guess who she is. I mentioned just now the name of Mrs. Armstrong’s mother. It was ‘Linda Arden,’ and she was a very celebrated <NOBR>actress—among</NOBR> other things a Shakespearean actress. Think of <SPAN class="ft22">As You Like It</SPAN>, with the Forest of Arden and Rosalind. It was there she got the inspiration for her acting name. ‘Linda Arden,’ the name by which she was known all over the world, was not her real name. It may have been Goldenberg; it is quite likely that she had Central European blood in her <NOBR>veins—a</NOBR> strain of Jewish, perhaps. Many nationalities drift to America. I suggest to you, gentlemen, that that young sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s, little more than a child at the time of the tragedy, was Helena Goldenberg, the younger daughter of Linda Arden, and that she married Count Andrenyi when he was an attaché in Washington.”</P>
<P class="p447 ft3">“But Princess Dragomiroff says that the girl married an Englishman.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Whose name she cannot remember! I ask you, my friends, is that really likely? Princess Dragomiroff loved Linda Arden as great ladies do love great artists. She was godmother to one of the actress’s daughters. Would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter? It is not likely. No, I think we can safely say that Princess Dragomiroff was lying. She knew Helena was on the train, she had seen her. She realised at once, as soon as she heard who Ratchett really was, that Helena would be suspected. And so, when we question her as to the sister, she promptly <NOBR>lies—is</NOBR> vague, cannot remember, but ‘thinks Helena married an <NOBR>Englishman’—a</NOBR> suggestion as far away from the truth as possible.”</P>

<P class="p393 ft11">THE GREASE SPOT ON A HUNGARIAN PASSPORT</P>
<P class="p202 ft3">Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc and the doctor.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The company assembled in the restaurant car was a very subdued one. They spoke little. Even the loquacious Mrs. Hubbard was unnaturally quiet. She murmured as she sat:</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I don’t feel as though I had the heart to eat anything,” and then partook of everything offered her, encouraged by the Swedish lady who seemed to regard her as a special charge.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Before the meal was served, Poirot had caught the chief attendant by the sleeve and murmured something to him. Constantine made a pretty good guess as to what the instructions had been when he noticed that the Count and Countess Andrenyi were always served last and that at the end of the meat there was a delay in making out their bill. It therefore came about that the Count and Countess were the last left in the restaurant car.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">When they rose at length and moved in the direction of the door, Poirot sprang up and followed them.</P>
<P class="p134 ft5">“Pardon, Madame, you have dropped your handkerchief.” He was holding out to her the tiny monogrammed square.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">She took it, glanced at it, then handed it back to him. “You are mistaken, Monsieur, that is not my handkerchief.”</P>
<P class="p163 ft5">“Not your handkerchief? Are you sure?” “Perfectly sure, Monsieur.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“And yet, Madame, it has your <NOBR>initial—the</NOBR> initial H.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The Count made a sudden movement. Poirot ignored him. His eyes were fixed on the Countess’s face.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Looking steadily at him she replied:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not understand, Monsieur. My initials are E. A.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“I think not. Your name is <NOBR>Helena—not</NOBR> Elena. Helena Goldenberg, the younger daughter of Linda <NOBR>Arden—Helena</NOBR> Goldenberg, the sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">There was a dead silence for a minute or two. Both the Count and the Countess had gone deadly white.</P>
<P class="p448 ft5">Poirot said in a gentler tone: “It is of no use denying. That is the truth, is it not?” The Count burst out furiously, “I demand, Monsieur, by what right <NOBR>you—”</NOBR> She interrupted him, putting up a small hand towards his mouth.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“No, Rudolph. Let me speak. It is useless to deny what this gentleman says. We had better sit down and talk the matter out.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">Her voice had changed. It still had the southern richness of tone, but it had become suddenly more clear cut and incisive. It was, for the first time, a definitely American voice.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The Count was silenced. He obeyed the gesture of her hand and they both sat down opposite Poirot.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Your statement, Monsieur, is quite true,” said the Countess. “I am Helena Goldenberg, the younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong.”</P>
<P class="p95 ft3">“You did not acquaint me with that fact this morning, Madame la Comtesse.” “No.”</P>

<P class="p449 ft3">“In fact, all that your husband and you told me was a tissue of lies.” “Monsieur!” cried the Count angrily.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Do not be angry, Rudolph. M. Poirot puts the fact rather brutally, but what he says is undeniable.”</P>
<P class="p70 ft23">“I am glad you admit the fact so freely, Madame. Will you now tell me your reasons for that, and also for altering your Christian name on your passport?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“That was my doing entirely,” put in the Count.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Helena said quietly: “Surely, M. Poirot, you can guess my <NOBR>reason—our</NOBR> reason. This man who was killed is the man who murdered my baby niece, who killed my sister, who broke my brother- <NOBR>in-law’s</NOBR> heart. Three of the people I loved best and who made up my <NOBR>home—my</NOBR> world!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Her voice rang out passionately. She was a true daughter of that mother the emotional force of whose acting had moved huge audiences to tears.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She went on more quietly.</P>
<P class="p450 ft5">“Of all the people on the train I alone had probably the best motive for killing him.” “And you did not kill him, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I swear to you, M. <NOBR>Poirot—and</NOBR> my husband <NOBR>knows—and</NOBR> will swear <NOBR>also—that</NOBR> much as I may have been tempted to do so, I never lifted a hand against that man.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I, too, gentlemen.” said the Count. “I give you my word of honour that last night Helena never left her compartment. She took a sleeping draught exactly as I said. She is utterly and entirely innocent.”</P>
<P class="p451 ft3">Poirot looked from one to the other of them. “On my word of honour,” repeated the Count. Poirot shook his head slightly.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“And yet you took it upon yourself to alter the name in the passport?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Monsieur Poirot,” the Count said earnestly and passionately, “consider my position. Do you think I could stand the thought of my wife dragged through a sordid police case? She was innocent, I knew it, but what she said was <NOBR>true—because</NOBR> of her connection with the Armstrong family she would have been immediately suspected. She would have been <NOBR>questioned—attested,</NOBR> perhaps. Since some evil chance had taken us on the same train as this man Ratchett, there was, I felt sure, but one thing for it. I admit, Monsieur, that I lied to <NOBR>you—all,</NOBR> that is, save in one thing. My wife never left her compartment last night.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He spoke with an earnestness that it was hard to gainsay.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I do not say that I disbelieve you, Monsieur,” said Poirot slowly. “Your family is, I know, a proud and ancient one. It would be bitter indeed for you to have your wife dragged into an unpleasant police case. With that I can sympathise. But how then do you explain the presence of your wife’s handkerchief actually in the dead man’s compartment?”</P>
<P class="p452 ft5">“That handkerchief is not mine, Monsieur,” said the Countess. “In spite of the initial H?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“In spite of the initial. I have handkerchiefs not unlike that, but not one that is exactly of that pattern. I know, of course, that I cannot hope to make you believe me, but I assure you that it is so. That handkerchief is not mine.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It may have been placed there by someone in order to incriminate you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">She smiled a little. “You are enticing me to admit that, after all, it is mine? But indeed, M. Poirot, it isn’t.” She spoke with great earnestness.</P>
<P class="p453 ft3">“Then why, if the handkerchief was not yours, did you alter the name in the passport?” The Count answered this.</P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“Because we heard that a handkerchief had been found with the initial H on it. We talked the matter over together before we came to be interviewed. I pointed out to Helena that if it were seen that her Christian name began with an H she would immediately be subjected to much more rigorous questioning. And the thing was so <NOBR>simple—to</NOBR> alter Helena to Elena, was easily done.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You have, M. le Comte, the makings of a very fine criminal,” remarked Poirot dryly. “A great natural ingenuity, and an apparently remorseless determination to mislead justice.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh, no, no.” The girl leaned forward. “M. Poirot, he’s explained to you how it was.” She broke from French into English. “I was <NOBR>scared—absolutely</NOBR> dead scared, you understand. It had been so <NOBR>awful—that</NOBR> <NOBR>time—and</NOBR> to have it all raked up again. And to be suspected and perhaps thrown into prison. I was just scared stiff, M. Poirot. Can’t you understand at all?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Her voice was <NOBR>lovely—deep—rich—pleading,</NOBR> the voice of the daughter of Linda Arden the actress.</P>
<P class="p113 ft3">Poirot looked gravely at her.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“If I am to believe you, <NOBR>Madame—and</NOBR> I do not say that I will <SPAN class="ft4">not </SPAN>believe <NOBR>you—then</NOBR> you must help me.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Help you?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Yes. The reason for the murder lies in the <NOBR>past—in</NOBR> that tragedy which broke up your home and saddened your young life. Take me back into the past, Mademoiselle, that I may find there the link that explains the whole thing.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What can there be to tell you? They are all dead.” She repeated mournfully: “All <NOBR>dead—all</NOBR> <NOBR>dead—Robert,</NOBR> <NOBR>Sonia—darling,</NOBR> darling Daisy. She was so <NOBR>sweet—so</NOBR> <NOBR>happy—she</NOBR> had such lovely curls. We were all just crazy about her.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“There was another victim, Madame. An indirect victim, you might say.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Poor Susanne? Yes, I had forgotten about her. The police questioned her. They were convinced that she had something to do with it. Perhaps she <NOBR>had—but</NOBR> if so only innocently. She had, I believe, chatted idly with someone, giving information as to the time of Daisy’s outings. The poor thing got terribly wrought <NOBR>up—she</NOBR> thought she was being held responsible.” She shuddered. “She threw herself out of the window. Oh! it was horrible.”</P>
<P class="p454 ft3">She buried her face in her hands. “What nationality was she, Madame?” “She was French.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“What was her last name?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“It’s absurd, but I can’t <NOBR>remember—we</NOBR> all called her Susanne. A pretty, laughing girl. She was devoted to Daisy.”</P>
<P class="p455 ft3">“She was the <NOBR>nursery-maid,</NOBR> was she not?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Who was the nurse?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“She was a trained hospital nurse. Stengelberg her name was. She too was devoted to Daisy— and to my sister.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully before you answer this question. Have you, since you were on this train, seen anyone that you recognised?”</P>
<P class="p163 ft5">She stared at him. “I? No, no one at all.” “What about Princess Dragomiroff?”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“Oh! her. I know her, of course. I thought you meant <NOBR>anyone—anyone</NOBR> <NOBR>from—from</NOBR> that time.” “So I did, Madame. Now think carefully. Some years have passed, remember. The person</P>

<P class="p4 ft3">“You do not believe the Count’s positive <NOBR>assertion—on</NOBR> his word of <NOBR>honor—that</NOBR> his wife is innocent?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Mon </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">cher</SPAN>—naturally—what</NOBR> else <SPAN class="ft4">could </SPAN>he say? He adores his wife. He wants to save her!

<P class="p5 ft3">“Well, you know, I had the preposterous idea that it might be the truth.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“No, no. The handkerchief, remember. The handkerchief clinches the matter.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh, I am not so sure about the handkerchief. You remember, I always told you that there were two possibilities as to the ownership of the handkerchief.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“All the <NOBR>same—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">M. Bouc broke off. The door at the end had opened, and Princess Dragomiroff entered the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> She came straight to them and all three men rose to their feet.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She spoke to Poirot, ignoring the others.</P>
<P class="p461 ft5">“I believe, Monsieur,” she said, “that you have a handkerchief of mine.” Poirot shot a glance of triumph at the other two.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Is this it, Madame?”</P>
<P class="p462 ft3">He produced the little square of fine cambric. “That is it. It has my initial in the corner.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“But, Madame la Princesse, that is the letter H,” said M. Bouc. “Your Christian name— pardon <NOBR>me—is</NOBR> Natalia.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She gave him a cold stare.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“That is correct, Monsieur. My handkerchiefs are always initialled in the Russian characters. H is N in Russian.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">M. Bouc was somewhat taken aback. There was something about this indomitable old lady which made him feel flustered and uncomfortable.</P>
<P class="p144 ft3">“You did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours at the inquiry this morning.” “You did not ask me,” said the Princess drily.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Pray be seated, Madame,” said Poirot.</P>
<P class="p323 ft3">She sighed. “I may as well, I suppose.” She sat down. “You need not make a long business of this, Messieurs.”</P>

<P class="p219 ft3">Your next question will <NOBR>be—How</NOBR> did my handkerchief come to be lying by a murdered man’s body! My reply to that is that I have no idea.”</P>
<P class="p463 ft3">“You have really no idea?” “None whatever.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“You will excuse me, Madame, but how much can we rely upon the truthfulness of your replies?”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Poirot said the words very softly.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Princess Dragomiroff answered contemptuously. “I suppose you mean because I did not tell you that Helena Andrenyi was Mrs. Armstrong’s sister?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“In fact you deliberately lied to us in the matter.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Certainly. I would do the same again. Her mother was my friend. I believe, Messieurs, in <NOBR>loyalty—to</NOBR> one’s friends and one’s family and one’s caste.”</P>
<P class="p464 ft5">“You do not believe in doing your utmost to further the ends of justice?” “In this case I consider that <NOBR>justice—strict</NOBR> <NOBR>justice—has</NOBR> been done.” Poirot leaned forward.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You see my difficulty, Madame. In this matter of the handkerchief, even, am I to believe you? Or are you shielding your friend’s daughter?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Oh! I see what you mean.” Her face broke into a grim smile. “Well, Messieurs, this statement of mine can be easily proved. I will give you the address of the people in Paris who make my handkerchiefs. You have only to show them the one in question and they will inform you that it was made to my order over a year ago. The handkerchief is mine, Messieurs.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She rose.</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">“Have you anything further you wish to ask me?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this handkerchief when we showed it to her this morning?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“She must have done so. She saw it and said nothing? Ah, well, that shows that she too can be loyal.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">With a slight inclination of her head she passed out of the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“So that was it,” murmured Poirot softly. “I noticed just a trifling hesitation when I asked the maid if she knew to whom the handkerchief belonged. She was uncertain whether or not to admit that it was her mistress’s. But how does that fit in with that strange central idea of mine? Yes, it might well be.”</P>
<P class="p465 ft23">“Ah!” said M. Bouc with a characteristic gesture. “She is a terrible old lady, that!” “Could she have murdered Ratchett?” asked Poirot of the doctor.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He shook his head.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Those <NOBR>blows—the</NOBR> ones delivered with great force penetrating the <NOBR>muscle—never,</NOBR> never could anyone with so frail a physique inflict them.”</P>
<P class="p466 ft3">“But the feebler ones?” “The feebler ones, yes.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I am thinking,” said Poirot, “of the incident this morning when I said to her that the strength was in her will rather than in her arm. It was in the nature of a trap, that remark. I wanted to see if she would look down at her right or her left arm. She did neither. She looked at them both. But she made a strange reply. She said, ‘No, I have no strength in these. I do not know whether to be sorry or glad.’ A curious remark that. It confirms me in my belief about the crime.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It did not settle the point about the <NOBR>left-handedness.”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p77 ft3">“No. By the way, did you notice that Count Andrenyi keeps his handkerchief in his <NOBR>right-hand</NOBR> breast pocket?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">M. Bouc shook his head. His mind reverted to the astonishing revelations of the last <NOBR>half-hour.</NOBR> He murmured:</P>
<P class="p467 ft5"><NOBR>“Lies—and</NOBR> again lies. It amazes me, the number of lies we had told to us this morning.” “There are more still to discover,” said Poirot cheerfully.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You think so?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I shall be very much disappointed if it is not so.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Such duplicity is terrible,” said M. Bouc. “But it seems to please you,” he added reproachfully.</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“It has this advantage,” said Poirot. “If you confront anyone who has lied with the truth, he will usually admit <NOBR>it—often</NOBR> out of sheer surprise. It is only necessary to guess <SPAN class="ft22">right </SPAN>to produce your effect.</P>
<P class="p70 ft5">“That is the only way to conduct this case.

We shall now proceed to try the same method on several other persons.”</P>
<P class="p468 ft3">“And supposing, my friend, that your guess happens to be wrong?” “Then one person, at any rate, will be completely freed from suspicion.” <NOBR>“Ah!—a</NOBR> process of elimination.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Exactly.”</P>

<P class="p469 ft11">A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL ARBUTHNOT</P>
<P class="p90 ft3">Colonel Arbuthnot was clearly annoyed at being summoned to the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> for a second interview. His face wore a most forbidding expression as he sat down and said:</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Well?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“All my apologies for troubling you a second time,” said Poirot. “But there is still some information that I think you might be able to give us.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Indeed? I hardly think so.”</P>
<P class="p470 ft5">“To begin with, you see this <NOBR>pipe-cleaner?”</NOBR> “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Is it one of yours?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Don’t know. I don’t put a private mark on them, you know.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“Are you aware, Colonel Arbuthnot, that you are the only man amongst the passengers in the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> carriage who smokes a pipe?”</P>
<P class="p163 ft5">“In that case it probably is one of mine.” “Do you know where it was found?” “Not the least idea.”</P>
<P class="p357 ft3">“It was found by the body of the murdered man.” Colonel Arbuthnot raised his eyebrows.</P>
<P class="p379 ft5">“Can you tell us, Colonel Arbuthnot, how it is likely to have got there?” “If you mean, did I drop it there myself, no, I didn’t.”</P>
<P class="p376 ft3">“Did you go into Mr. Ratchett’s compartment at any time?” “I never even spoke to the man.”</P>
<P class="p75 ft5">“You never spoke to him and you did not murder him?” The colonel’s eyebrows went up again sardonically.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“If I had, I should hardly be likely to acquaint you with the fact. As a matter of fact I <SPAN class="ft22">didn’t </SPAN>murder the fellow.”</P>
<P class="p471 ft5">“Ah, well,” murmured Poirot. “It is of no consequence.” “I beg your pardon?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I said that it was of no consequence.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Oh!” Arbuthnot looked taken aback. He eyed Poirot uneasily.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Because, you see,” continued the little man, “the <NOBR>pipe-cleaner,</NOBR> it is of no importance. I can myself think of eleven other excellent explanations of its presence.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot stared at him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“What I really wished to see you about was quite another matter,” went on Poirot. “Miss Debenham may have told you, perhaps, that I overheard some words spoken to you at the station of Konya?”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Arbuthnot did not reply.</P>
<P class="p4 ft22"><SPAN class="ft3">“She said, ‘</SPAN>Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us<SPAN class="ft3">!’ Do you know to what those words referred?”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p409 ft3">“I am sorry, M. Poirot, but I must refuse to answer that question.” “<SPAN class="ft22">Pourquoi</SPAN>?”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p219 ft3">The Colonel said stiffly, “I suggest that you ask Miss Debenham herself for the meaning of those words.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I have done so.”</P>
<P class="p472 ft5">“And she refused to tell you?” “Yes.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Then I should think it would have been perfectly <NOBR>plain—even</NOBR> to <NOBR>you—that</NOBR> my lips are sealed.”</P>
<P class="p473 ft3">“You will not give away a lady’s secret?” “You can put it that way, if you like.”</P>
<P class="p474 ft3">“Miss Debenham told me that they referred to a private matter of her own.” “Then why not accept her word for it?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Because, Colonel Arbuthnot, Miss Debenham is what one might call a highly suspicious character.”</P>
<P class="p475 ft3">“Nonsense,” said the Colonel with warmth. “It is not nonsense.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“You have nothing whatever against her.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Not the fact that Miss Debenham was companion governess; in the Armstrong household at the time of the kidnapping of little Daisy Armstrong?”</P>
<P class="p476 ft5">There was a minute’s dead silence. Poirot nodded his head gently.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“You see,” he said. “We know more than you think. If Miss Debenham is innocent, why did she conceal that fact? Why did she tell me that she had never been in America?”</P>
<P class="p73 ft3">The Colonel cleared his throat. “Aren’t you possibly making a mistake?” “I am making no mistake. Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">Colonel Arbuthnot shrugged his shoulders. “You had better ask her. I still think that you are wrong.”</P>
<P class="p146 ft3">Poirot raised his voice and called. One of the restaurant attendants came from the far end of the car.</P>
<P class="p477 ft3">“Go and ask the English lady in No. 11 if she will be good enough to come here.” “<SPAN class="ft22">Bien, Monsieur</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">The man departed. The four men sat in silence. Colonel Arbuthnot’s face looked as though it were carved out of wood, rigid and impassive.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">The man returned.</P>
<P class="p478 ft5">“The lady is just coming, Monsieur.” “Thank you.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">A minute or two later Mary Debenham entered the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR></P>

<P class="p479 ft11">THE IDENTITY OF MARY DEBENHAM</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">She wore no hat. Her head was thrown back as though in defiance. “The sweep of her hair back from her face, the curve of her nostril suggested the <NOBR>figure-head</NOBR> of a ship plunging gallantly into a rough sea. In that moment she was beautiful.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Her eyes went to Arbuthnot for a <NOBR>minute—just</NOBR> a minute. She said to Poirot, “You wished to see me?”</P>
<P class="p242 ft5">“I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you lied to us this morning?” “Lied to you? I don’t know what you mean.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You concealed the fact that at the time of the Armstrong tragedy you were actually living in the house. You told me that you had never been in America.”</P>
<P class="p370 ft3">He saw her flinch for a moment and then recover herself. “Yes,” she said. “That is true.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“No, Mademoiselle, it was false.”</P>
<P class="p443 ft5">“You misunderstood me. I mean that it is true that I lied to you.” “Ah, you admit it?”</P>
<P class="p242 ft5">Her lips curved into a smile. “Certainly, since you have found me out.” “You are at least frank, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“There does not seem anything else for me to be.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Well, of course, that is true. And now, Mademoiselle, may I ask you the reason for these evasions?”</P>
<P class="p480 ft3">“I should have thought the reason leapt to the eye, M. Poirot.” “It does not leap to mine, Mademoiselle.”</P>
<P class="p164 ft5">She said in a quiet even voice with a trace of hardness in it, “I have my living to get.” “You <NOBR>mean—?”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She raised her eyes and looked him full in the face. “How much do you know, M. Poirot, of the fight to get and keep decent employment? Do you think that a girl who had been detained in connection with a murder case, whose name and perhaps photograph were reproduced in the English <NOBR>papers—do</NOBR> you think that any nice ordinary <NOBR>middle-class</NOBR> woman would want to engage that girl as governess to her daughters?”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I do not see why <NOBR>not—if</NOBR> no blame attached to you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Oh, <NOBR>blame—it</NOBR> is not <NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">blame</SPAN>—it</NOBR> is the publicity! So far, M. Poirot, I have succeeded in life. I have had <NOBR>well-paid,</NOBR> pleasant posts. I was not going to risk the position I had attained when no good end could have been served.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I will venture to suggest, Mademoiselle, that I would have been the best judge of that, not you.”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">She shrugged her shoulders.</P>
<P class="p464 ft3">“For instance, you could have helped me in the matter of identification.” “What do you mean?”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Is it possible, Mademoiselle, that you did not recognise in the Countess Andrenyi, Mrs. Armstrong’s young sister whom you taught in New York?”</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p99 ft5">“Countess Andrenyi? No.” She shook her head. “It may seem extraordinary to <NOBR>you—but</NOBR> I did not recognise her. She was not grown up, you see, when I knew her. That was over three years ago. It is true that the Countess reminded me of someone; it puzzled me. But she looks so <NOBR>foreign—I</NOBR> never connected her with the little American schoolgirl. I only glanced at her casually when coming into the restaurant car, and I noticed her clothes more than her face.” She smiled faintly. “Women do! And <NOBR>then—well—I</NOBR> had my own preoccupations.”</P>
<P class="p481 ft3">“You will not tell me your secret, Mademoiselle?” Poirot’s voice was very gentle and persuasive. She said in a low voice, “I <NOBR>can’t—I</NOBR> can’t.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">And suddenly, without warning, she broke down, dropping her face down upon her outstretched arms and crying as though her heart would break.</P>
<P class="p471 ft5">The Colonel sprang up and stood awkwardly beside her. <NOBR>“I—look</NOBR> <NOBR>here—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He stopped and turning round scowled fiercely at Poirot.</P>
<P class="p482 ft5">“I’ll break every bone in your damned body, you dirty little <NOBR>whipper-snapper,”</NOBR> he said. “Monsieur,” protested M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot had turned back to the girl. <NOBR>“Mary—for</NOBR> God’s <NOBR>sake—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She sprang up. “It’s nothing. I’m all right. You don’t need me any more, do you, M. Poirot? If you do, you must come and find me. Oh, what an <NOBR>idiot—what</NOBR> an idiot I’m making of myself!” She hurried out of the car.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Arbuthnot, before following her, turned once more on Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Miss Debenham’s got nothing to do with this <NOBR>business—nothing,</NOBR> do you hear? And if she’s worried and interfered with, you’ll have me to deal with.” He strode out.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I like to see an angry Englishman,” said Poirot. “They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel, the less command they have of language.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">But M. Bouc was not interested in the emotional reactions of Englishmen. He was overcome by admiration of his friend.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mon cher, vous êtes épatant</SPAN>!” he cried. “Another miraculous guess.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“It is incredible how you think of these things,” said Dr. Constantine admiringly.</P>
<P class="p483 ft5">“Oh, I claim no credit this time. It was not a guess. Countess Andrenyi practically told me.” “<SPAN class="ft4">Comment</SPAN>? Surely not?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“You remember, I asked her about her governess or companion? I had already decided in my mind that <SPAN class="ft4">if </SPAN>Mary Debenham were mixed up in the matter, she must have figured in the household in some such capacity.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, but the Countess Andrenyi described a totally different person.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Exactly. A tall <NOBR>middle-aged</NOBR> woman with red <NOBR>hair—in</NOBR> fact, the exact opposite in every respect of Miss Debenham, so much so as to be quite remarkable. But then she had to invent a name quickly, and there it was that the unconscious association of ideas gave her away. She said, Miss Freebody, you remember.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Eh bien</SPAN>, you may not know it, but there is a shop in London that was called until recently Debenham & Freebody. With the name Debenham running in her head, the Countess clutches at another name quickly, and the first that comes is Freebody. Naturally I understood immediately.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“That is yet another lie. Why did she do it?’</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Possibly more loyalty. It makes things a little difficult.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Ma foi</SPAN>!” said M. Bouc with violence. “But does everybody on this train tell lies?”</P>

<P class="p202 ft3">“Nothing would surprise me now,” said M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“Nothing! Even if everybody in the train proved to have been in the Armstrong household, I should not express surprise.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“That is a very profound remark,” said Poirot. “Would you like to see what your favorite suspect, the Italian, has to say for himself?”</P>
<P class="p350 ft5">“You are going to make another of these famous guesses of yours?” “Precisely.”</P>
<P class="p487 ft5">“It is really a <SPAN class="ft4">most </SPAN>extraordinary case,” said Constantine. “No, it is most natural.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">M. Bouc flung up his arms in comic despair. “If this is what you call natural, <SPAN class="ft22">mon </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">ami</SPAN>—”</NOBR> Words failed him.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot had by this time requested the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> attendant to fetch Antonio Foscarelli.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">The big Italian had a wary look in his eye as he came in. He shot nervous glances from side to side like a trapped animal.</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“What do you want!” he said. “I have nothing more to tell <NOBR>you—nothing,</NOBR> do you hear? <SPAN class="ft4">Per </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">Dio</SPAN>—”</NOBR> He struck his hand on the table.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Yes, you have something more to tell us,” said Poirot firmly. “The truth!”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“The truth?” He shot an uneasy glance at Poirot. All the assurance and geniality had gone out of his manner.</P>
<P class="p80 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Mais oui</SPAN>. It may be that I know it already. But it will be a point in your favour if it comes from you spontaneously.”</P>
<P class="p223 ft5">“You talk like the American police. ‘Come <NOBR>clean’—that</NOBR> is what they <NOBR>say—‘come</NOBR> clean.’ ” “Ah! so you have had experience of the New York police?”</P>
<P class="p105 ft5">“No, no, never. They could not prove a thing against <NOBR>me—but</NOBR> it was not for want of trying.” Poirot said quietly: “That was in the Armstrong case, was it not? You were the chauffeur?” His eyes met those of the Italian. The bluster went out of the big man. He was like a pricked</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">balloon.</P>
<P class="p488 ft3">“Since you <NOBR>know—why</NOBR> ask me?” “Why did you lie this morning?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Business reasons. Besides, I do not trust the <NOBR>Jugo-Slav</NOBR> police. They hate the Italians. They would not have given me justice.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Perhaps it is exactly justice that they <SPAN class="ft22">would </SPAN>have given you!”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“No, no, I had nothing to do with this business last night. I never left my carriage. The long- faced Englishman, he can tell you so. It was not I who killed this <NOBR>pig—this</NOBR> Ratchett. You cannot prove anything against me.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot was writing something on a sheet of paper. He looked up and said quietly: “Very good. You can go.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Foscarelli lingered uneasily. “You realise that it was not I? That I could have had nothing to do with it!”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“I said that you could go.”</P>

<P class="p489 ft5">The <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> attendant came at a run. “The No. <NOBR>10—the</NOBR> Swedish lady.” “<SPAN class="ft4">Bien, Monsieur</SPAN>.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Another?” cried M. Bouc. “Ah, <NOBR>no—it</NOBR> is not possible. I tell you it is not possible.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Mon </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">cher</SPAN>—we</NOBR> have to <SPAN class="ft4">know</SPAN>. Even if in the end everybody on the train proves to have had a motive for killing Ratchett, we have to know. Once we know, we can settle once for all where the guilt lies.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“My head is spinning,” groaned M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p122 ft3">Greta Ohlsson was ushered in sympathetically by the attendant. She was weeping bitterly. She collapsed on the seat facing Poirot and wept steadily into a large handkerchief.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Now do not distress yourself, Mademoiselle. Do not distress yourself,” Poirot patted her on the shoulder. “Just a few little words of truth, that is all. You were the nurse who was in charge of little Daisy Armstrong?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“It is <NOBR>true—it</NOBR> is true,” wept the wretched woman. “Ah, she was an <NOBR>angel—a</NOBR> little sweet trustful angel. She knew nothing but kindness and <NOBR>love—and</NOBR> she was taken away by that wicked <NOBR>man—cruelly</NOBR> <NOBR>treated—and</NOBR> her poor <NOBR>mother—and</NOBR> the other little one who never lived at all. You cannot <NOBR>understand—you</NOBR> cannot <NOBR>know—if</NOBR> you had been there as I <NOBR>was—if</NOBR> you had seen the whole terrible tragedy! I ought to have told you the truth about myself this morning. But I was <NOBR>afraid—afraid.</NOBR> I did so rejoice that that evil man was <NOBR>dead—that</NOBR> he could not any more kill or torture little children. Ah! I cannot <NOBR>speak—I</NOBR> have no words. ...”</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">She wept with more vehemence than ever.</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">Poirot continued to pat her gently on the shoulder. <NOBR>“There—there—I</NOBR> <NOBR>comprehend—I</NOBR> comprehend <NOBR>everything—everything,</NOBR> I tell you. I will ask you no more questions. It is enough that you have admitted what I know to be the truth. I understand, I tell you.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">By now inarticulate with sobs, Greta Ohlsson rose and groped her way towards the door. As she reached it she collided with a man coming in.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">It was the <NOBR>valet—Masterman.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft5">He came straight up to Poirot and spoke in his usual quiet, unemotional voice’.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I hope I’m not intruding, sir. I thought it best to come along at once, sir, and tell you the truth. I was Colonel Armstrong’s batman in the War, sir, and afterwards I was his valet in New York. I’m afraid I concealed that fact this morning. It was very wrong of me, sir, and I thought I’d better come and make a clean breast of it. But I hope, sir, that you’re not suspecting Tonio in any way. Old Tonio, sir, wouldn’t hurt a fly. And I can swear positively that he never left the carriage all last night. So, you see, sir, he couldn’t have done it. Tonio may be a foreigner, sir, but he’s a very gentle creature. Not like those nasty murdering Italians one reads about.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He stopped.</P>
<P class="p154 ft3">Poirot looked steadily at him. “Is that all you have to say?”</P>

<P class="p65 ft3">“That is all, sir.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">He paused; then, as Poirot did not speak, he made an apologetic little bow and after a momentary hesitation left the <NOBR>dining-car</NOBR> in the same quiet unobtrusive fashion as he had come.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“This,” said Dr. Constantine, “is more wildly improbable than any <SPAN class="ft22">roman policier </SPAN>I have ever read.”</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“I agree,” said M. Bouc. “Of the twelve passengers in that coach, nine have been proved to have had a connection with the Armstrong case. What next, I ask you? Or should I say, who next?”</P>
<P class="p70 ft3">“I can almost give you the answer to your question,” said Poirot. “Here comes our American sleuth, Mr. Hardman.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“Is he, too, coming to confess?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Before Poirot could reply the American had reached their table. He cocked an alert eye at them and sitting down he drawled out: “Just exactly what’s up on this train? It seems bughouse to me.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">Poirot twinkled at him.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Are you quite sure, Mr. Hardman, that you yourself were not the gardener at the Armstrong home?”</P>
<P class="p490 ft3">“They didn’t have a garden,” replied Mr. Hardman literally. “Or the butler?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Haven’t got the fancy manners for a place like that. No, I never had any connection with the Armstrong <NOBR>house—but</NOBR> I’m beginning to believe I’m about the only one on this train who hadn’t! Can you beat it? That’s what I <NOBR>say—can</NOBR> you beat it?”</P>
<P class="p300 ft3">“It is certainly a little surprising,” said Poirot mildly. “<SPAN class="ft22">C’est rigolo</SPAN>,” burst from M. Bouc.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“Have you any ideas of your own about the crime, Mr. Hardman?” inquired Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, sir. It’s got me beat. I don’t know how to figure it out. They can’t <SPAN class="ft22">all </SPAN>be in <NOBR>it—but</NOBR> which one is the guilty party is beyond me. How did you get wise to all this? That’s what I want to know.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“I just guessed.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Then, believe me, you’re a pretty slick guesser. Yes, I’ll tell the world you’re a slick guesser.”</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">Mr. Hardman leaned back and looked at Poirot admiringly.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You’ll excuse me,” he said, “but no one would believe it to look at you. I take off my hat to you. I do indeed.”</P>
<P class="p491 ft3">“You are too kind, M. Hardman.” “Not at all. I’ve got to hand it to you.”</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">“All the same,” said Poirot, “the problem is not yet quite solved. Can we say with authority that we know who killed M. Ratchett?”</P>
<P class="p81 ft5">“Count me out,” said Mr. Hardman. “I’m not saying anything at all. I’m just full of natural admiration. What about the other two you haven’t had a guess at yet? The old American dame, and the <NOBR>lady’s-maid?</NOBR> I suppose we can take it that they’re the only innocent parties on the train?” “Unless,” said Poirot, smiling, “we can fit them into our little collection <NOBR>as—shall</NOBR> we say—</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">housekeeper and cook in the Armstrong household?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well, nothing in the world would surprise me now,” said Mr. Hardman with quiet resignation. <NOBR>“Bughouse—that’s</NOBR> what this business <NOBR>is—bughouse!”</NOBR></P>

<P class="p492 ft11">POIROT PROPOUNDS TWO SOLUTIONS</P>
<P class="p118 ft3">The passengers came crowding into the restaurant car and took their seats round the tables. They all bore more or less the same expression, one of expectancy mingled with apprehension. The Swedish lady was still weeping, and Mrs. Hubbard was comforting her.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Now you must just take a hold on yourself, my dear. Everything’s going to be perfectly all right. You mustn’t lose your grip on yourself. If one of us is a nasty murderer, we know quite well it isn’t you. Why, anyone would be crazy even to think of such a thing. You sit here, and I’ll stay right by <NOBR>you—and</NOBR> don’t you worry any.” Her voice died away as Poirot stood up.</P>
<P class="p493 ft3">The Wagon Lit conductor was hovering in the doorway. “You permit that I stay, Monsieur?” “Certainly, Michel.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot cleared his throat.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“<SPAN class="ft4">Messieurs et mesdames</SPAN>, I will speak in English since I think all of you know a little of that language. We are here to investigate the death of Samuel Edward <NOBR>Ratchett—<SPAN class="ft4">alias</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> </SPAN>Cassetti. There are two possible solutions of the crime. I shall put them both before you, and I shall ask M. Bouc, and Dr. Constantine here to judge which solution is the right one.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now you all know the facts of the case. Mr. Ratchett was found stabbed this morning. He was last known to be alive at 12.37 last night when he spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor through the door. A watch in his pyjama pocket was found to be badly dented, and it had stopped at a quarter past one. Dr. Constantine, who examined the body when found, puts the time of death as having been between midnight and two in the morning. At half an hour after midnight, as you all know, the train ran into a snowdrift. After that time <SPAN class="ft22">it was impossible for anyone to leave the train</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“The evidence of Mr. Hardman, who is a member of a New York detective <NOBR>agency—”</NOBR> (Several heads turned, to look at Mr. <NOBR>Hardman.)—“shows</NOBR> that no one could have passed his compartment (No. 16 at the extreme end) without being seen by him. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the murderer is to be found among the occupants of one particular coach— the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> coach.</P>
<P class="p108 ft3">“That, I will say, <SPAN class="ft22">was </SPAN>our theory.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">Comment</SPAN>?” ejaculated M. Bouc, startled.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“But I will put before you an alternative theory. It is very simple. Mr. Ratchett had a certain enemy whom he feared. He gave Mr. Hardman a description of this enemy and told him that the attempt, if made at all, would most probably be made on the second night out from Stamboul.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr. Ratchett knew a good deal more than he told. The enemy, as Mr. Ratchett expected, joined the train <SPAN class="ft22">at Belgrade or else at Vincovci </SPAN>by the door left open by Colonel Arbuthnot and Mr. MacQueen, who had just descended to the platform. He was provided with a suit of Wagon Lit uniform, which he wore over his ordinary clothes, and a <NOBR>pass-key</NOBR> which enabled him to gain access to Mr. Ratchett’s compartment in spite of the door’s being locked. Mr. Ratchett was under the influence of a sleeping draught. This man stabbed him with great ferocity and left the compartment through the communicating door leading to Mrs. Hubbard’s <NOBR>compartment—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“That’s so,” said Mrs. Hubbard, nodding her head.</P>

<DIV id="id131_1">
<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p99 ft5">“He thrust the dagger he had used into Mrs. Hubbard’s <NOBR>sponge-bag</NOBR> in passing. Without knowing it, he lost a button of his uniform. Then he slipped out of the compartment and along the corridor. He hastily thrust the uniform into a suitcase in an empty compartment, and a few minutes later, dressed in ordinary clothes, he left the train just before it started off, using the same means for <NOBR>egress—the</NOBR> door near the <NOBR>dining-car.”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p384 ft3">Everybody gasped.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“What about that watch?” demanded Mr. Hardman.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“There you have the explanation of the whole thing. <SPAN class="ft4">Mr. Ratchett had omitted to put his watch back an hour as he should have done at Tzaribrod</SPAN>. His watch still registered Eastern European time, which is one hour ahead of Central European time. It was a quarter past twelve when Mr. Ratchett was <NOBR>stabbed—not</NOBR> a quarter past one.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“But it is absurd, that explanation!” cried M. Bouc. “What of the voice that spoke from the compartment at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one? It was either the voice of <NOBR>Ratchett—or</NOBR> else that of his murderer.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Not necessarily. It might have <NOBR>been—well—a</NOBR> third person. One who had gone in to speak to Ratchett and found him dead. He rang the bell to summon the conductor; then, as you express it, the wind rose in <NOBR>him—he</NOBR> was afraid of being accused of the crime, and he spoke pretending to be Ratchett.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“<SPAN class="ft22">C’est possible</SPAN>,” admitted M. Bouc grudgingly.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Poirot looked at Mrs. Hubbard. “Yes, Madame, you were going to <NOBR>say—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well, I don’t quite know what I was going to say. Do you think I forgot to put my watch back too?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“No, Madame. I think you heard the man pass <NOBR>through—but</NOBR> unconsciously. Later you had a nightmare of a man being in your compartment and woke up with a start and rang for the conductor.”</P>
<P class="p72 ft3">“Well, I suppose that’s possible,” admitted Mrs. Hubbard.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Princess Dragomiroff was looking at Poirot with a very direct glance. “How do you explain the evidence of my maid, Monsieur?”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Very simply, Madame. Your maid recognised the handkerchief I showed her as yours. She somewhat clumsily tried to shield you. She did encounter the man, but <NOBR>earlier—while</NOBR> the train was at Vincovci station. She pretended to have seen him at a later hour, with a confused idea of giving you a <NOBR>water-tight</NOBR> alibi.”</P>
<P class="p411 ft3">The Princess bowed her head. “You have thought of everything, Monsieur. <NOBR>I—I</NOBR> admire you.” There was a silence.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">Then everyone jumped as Dr. Constantine suddenly hit the table a blow with his fist.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“But no,” he said. “No, no, and again no! That is an explanation that will not hold water. It is deficient in a dozen minor points. The crime was not committed <NOBR>so—M.</NOBR> Poirot must know that perfectly well.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">Poirot turned a curious glance on him. “I see,” he said, “that I shall have to give you my second solution. But do not abandon this one too abruptly. You may agree with it later.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He turned back again to face the others.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“There is another possible solution of the crime. This is how I arrived at it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“When I had heard all the evidence, I leaned back and shut my eyes, and began to <SPAN class="ft22">think</SPAN>. Certain points presented themselves to me as worthy of attention. I enumerated these points to my two colleagues. Some I have already <NOBR>elucidated—such</NOBR> as a grease spot on a passport, and so on. I will run over the points that remain. The first and most important is a remark made to me by</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p43 ft3">M. Bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leaving <NOBR>Stamboul—to</NOBR> the effect that the company assembled was interesting because it was so <NOBR>varied—representing</NOBR> as it did all classes and nationalities.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I agreed with him, but when this particular point came into my mind, I tried to imagine whether such an assembly was ever likely to be collected under any other conditions. And the answer I made to myself <NOBR>was—only</NOBR> in America. In America there might be a household composed of just such varied <NOBR>nationalities—an</NOBR> Italian chauffeur, an English governess, a Swedish nurse, a German <NOBR>lady’s-maid,</NOBR> and so on. That led me to my scheme of <NOBR>‘guessing’—that</NOBR> is, casting each person for a certain part in the Armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play. Well, that gave me an extremely interesting and satisfactory result.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I had also examined in my own mind each separate person’s evidence, with some curious results. Take first the evidence of Mr. MacQueen. My first interview with him was entirely satisfactory. But in my second he made rather a curious remark. I had described to him the finding of a note mentioning the Armstrong case. He said, ‘But <NOBR>surely—’</NOBR> and then paused and went on, ‘I <NOBR>mean—that</NOBR> was rather careless of the old man.’</P>
<P class="p100 ft3">“Now I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say. <SPAN class="ft22">Supposing what he had meant to say was ‘But surely that was burnt!’ </SPAN>In which case, <SPAN class="ft22">MacQueen knew of the note and of its </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">destruction</SPAN>—in</NOBR> other words, he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer. Very good.</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">“Then the valet. He said his master was in the habit of taking a sleeping draught when travelling by train. That might be true, <SPAN class="ft22">but would Ratchett have taken one last night</SPAN>? The automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement. Ratchett intended to be on the alert last night. Whatever narcotic was administered to him must have been given without his knowledge. By whom? Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Now we come to the evidence of Mr. Hardman. I believed all that he told me about his own identity, but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to guard Mr. Ratchett, his story was neither more nor less than absurd. The only way to have protected Ratchett effectively was to pass the night actually in his compartment or in some spot where he could watch the door. The one thing that his evidence <SPAN class="ft22">did </SPAN>show plainly was that <SPAN class="ft22">no one in any other part of the train could possibly have murdered Ratchett</SPAN>. It drew a clear circle round the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> carriage. That seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact, and I put it aside to think over.</P>
<P class="p494 ft5">“You probably all know by now of the few words I overheard between Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The interesting thing to my mind was the fact that Colonel Arbuthnot called her <SPAN class="ft4">Mary </SPAN>and was clearly on terms of intimacy with her. But the Colonel was supposed to have met her only a few days previously. And I know Englishmen of the Colonel’s <NOBR>type—even</NOBR> if he had fallen in love with the young lady at first sight, he would have advanced slowly and with decorum, not rushing things. Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss Debenham were in reality well acquainted and were for some reason pretending to be strangers. Another small point was Miss Debenham’s easy familiarity with the term ‘long distance’ for a telephone call. Yet Miss Debenham had told me that she had never been in the States.</P>
<P class="p495 ft3">“To pass to another witness. Mrs. Hubbard had told us that lying in bed she had been unable to see whether the communicating door was bolted or not, and so had asked Miss Ohlsson to see for her. <NOBR>Now—though</NOBR> her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying compartment No. 2, 4, 12 or any <SPAN class="ft22">even </SPAN>number, in which the bolt is directly under the handle of the <NOBR>door—in</NOBR> the <SPAN class="ft22">uneven </SPAN>numbers such as compartment No. 3 the bolt is well <SPAN class="ft22">above </SPAN>the handle</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p197 ft3">and could not therefore be masked by the <NOBR>sponge-bag</NOBR> in the least. I was forced to the conclusion that Mrs. Hubbard was inventing an incident that had never occurred.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“And here let me say just a word or two about <SPAN class="ft22">times</SPAN>. To my mind the really interesting point about the dented watch, is the place where it was <NOBR>found—in</NOBR> Ratchett’s pyjama pocket, a singularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep one’s watch, especially as there is a watch ‘hook’ provided just by the head of the bed. I felt sure, therefore, that the watch had been deliberately placed in the <NOBR>pocket—faked.</NOBR> The crime, then, was not committed at a quarter past one.</P>
<P class="p135 ft5">“Was it then committed earlier? To be exact, at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one? My friend M. Bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep. But if Ratchett had been heavily drugged, <SPAN class="ft4">he could not have cried out</SPAN>. If he had been capable of crying out, he would have been capable of making some kind of struggle to defend himself, and there were no signs of any such struggle.</P>
<P class="p198 ft3">“I remembered that MacQueen had called attention, not once but twice (and the second time in a very blatant manner), to the fact that Ratchett could speak no French. I came to the conclusion that the whole business at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one was a comedy played for my benefit! Anyone might see through the watch <NOBR>business—it</NOBR> is a common enough device in detective stories. They assumed that I <SPAN class="ft22">should </SPAN>see through it and that, pluming myself on my own cleverness, I would go on to assume that since Ratchett spoke no French, the voice I heard at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one could not have been his, and that Ratchett must have been already dead. But I am convinced that at <NOBR>twenty-three</NOBR> minutes to one Ratchett was still lying in his drugged sleep.</P>
<P class="p135 ft3">“But the device has succeeded! I have opened my door and looked out. I have actually heard the French phrase used. If I am so unbelievably dense as not to realise the significance of that phrase, it must be brought to my attention. If necessary, MacQueen can come right out in the open. He can say, ‘Excuse me, M. Poirot, <SPAN class="ft22">that can’t have been Mr. Ratchett speaking</SPAN>. He couldn’t speak French.’</P>
<P class="p110 ft3">“Now, what was the real time of the crime? And who killed him?</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“In my <NOBR>opinion—and</NOBR> this is only an <NOBR>opinion—Ratchett</NOBR> was killed at some time very close upon two o’clock, the latest hour the doctor gives us as possible.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">“As to who killed <NOBR>him—”</NOBR></P>
<P class="p4 ft5">He paused, looking at his audience. He could not complain of any lack of attention. Every eye was fixed upon him. In the stillness you could have heard a pin drop.</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He went on slowly:</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one person on the train, and by the rather curious coincidence that in each case the testimony giving an alibi came from what I might describe as an ‘unlikely’ person. Thus, Mr. MacQueen and Colonel Arbuthnot provided alibis for each <NOBR>other—two</NOBR> persons between whom it seemed most unlikely there should have been any prior acquaintanceship. The same thing happened with the English valet and the Italian, and with the Swedish lady and the English girl. I said to myself: This is <NOBR>extraordinary—they</NOBR> cannot <SPAN class="ft22">all </SPAN>be in it!</P>
<P class="p124 ft3">“And then, Messieurs, I saw light. They <SPAN class="ft22">were </SPAN>all in it. For so many people connected with the Armstrong case to be travelling by the same train through coincidence was not only unlikely: it was <SPAN class="ft22">impossible</SPAN>. It must be not chance, but <SPAN class="ft22">design</SPAN>. I remembered a remark of Colonel Arbuthnot’s about trial by jury. A jury is composed of twelve <NOBR>people—there</NOBR> were twelve <NOBR>passengers—Ratchett</NOBR> was stabbed twelve times. And the thing that had worried me all along—</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">the extraordinary crowd travelling in the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> coach at a slack time of <NOBR>year—this</NOBR> was explained.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Ratchett had escaped justice in America. There was no question as to his guilt. I visualised a <NOBR>self-appointed</NOBR> jury of twelve people who had condemned him to death and who by the exigencies of the case had themselves been forced to be his executioners. And immediately, on that assumption, the whole case fell into beautiful shining order.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I saw it as a perfect mosaic, each person playing his or her allotted part. It was so arranged that, if suspicion should fall on any one person, the evidence of one or more of the others would clear the accused person and confuse the issue. Hardman’s evidence was necessary in case some outsider should be suspected of the crime and be unable to prove an alibi. The passengers in the Stamboul carriage were in no danger. Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out beforehand. The whole thing was a very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle, so arranged that every fresh piece of knowledge that came to light made the solution of the whole more difficult. As my friend M. Bouc remarked, the case seemed fantastically impossible! That was exactly the impression intended to be conveyed.</P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“Did this solution explain everything? Yes, it did. The nature of the <NOBR>wounds—each</NOBR> inflicted by a different person. The artificial threatening <NOBR>letters—artificial</NOBR> since they were unreal, written only to be produced as evidence. (Doubtless there <SPAN class="ft22">were </SPAN>real letters, warning Ratchett of his fate, which MacQueen destroyed, substituting for them these others.) Then Hardman’s story of being called in by <NOBR>Ratchett—a</NOBR> lie, of course, from beginning to end. The description of the mythical ‘small dark man with a womanish <NOBR>voice’—a</NOBR> convenient description since it had the merit of not incriminating any of the actual Wagon Lit conductors and would apply equally well to a man or a woman.</P>
<P class="p124 ft5">“The idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one, but on reflection nothing else would fit the circumstances so well. A dagger was a weapon that could be used by <NOBR>everyone—strong</NOBR> or <NOBR>weak—and</NOBR> it made no noise. I fancy, though I may be wrong, that each person in turn entered Ratchett’s darkened compartment through that of Mrs. <NOBR>Hubbard—and</NOBR> struck! They themselves would never know which blow actually killed him.</P>
<P class="p198 ft5">“The final letter which Ratchett had probably found on his pillow was carefully burnt. With no clue pointing to the Armstrong case there would be absolutely no reason for suspecting any of the passengers on the train. It would be put down as an outside job, and the ‘small dark man with the womanish voice’ would actually have been seen by one or more of the passengers leaving the train, at Brod!</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“I do not know exactly what happened when the conspirators discovered that this part of their plan was impossible owing to the accident to the train. There was, I imagine, a hasty consultation, and then they decided to go through with it. It was true that now one and all of the passengers were bound to come under suspicion, but that possibility had already been foreseen and provided for. The only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further. Two <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> ‘clues’ were dropped in the dead man’s <NOBR>compartment—one</NOBR> incriminating Colonel Arbuthnot (who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was probably the hardest to prove); and the second clue, the handkerchief, incriminating Princess Dragomiroff who, by virtue of her social position, her particularly frail physique and the alibi given her by her maid and the conductor, was practically in an unassailable position.</P>
<P class="p495 ft3">“Further to confuse the issue, a red herring was drawn across the <NOBR>trail—the</NOBR> mythical woman in the red kimono. Again I am to bear witness to this woman’s existence. There is a heavy bang at my door. I get up and look <NOBR>out—and</NOBR> see the scarlet kimono disappearing in the distance. A</P>

<P class="p0 ft1">Agatha Christie <SPAN class="ft0"> </SPAN>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</P>
<P class="p197 ft3">judicious selection of <NOBR>people—the</NOBR> conductor, Miss Debenham and <NOBR>MacQueen—will</NOBR> also have seen her. It was, I think, someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing people in the <NOBR>dining-car.</NOBR> Where the garment came from in the first place, I do not know. I suspect it is the property of Countess Andrenyi, since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee so elaborate as to be rather a tea- gown than a <NOBR>dressing-gown.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p63 ft3">“When MacQueen first learned that the letter which had been so carefully burnt had in part escaped destruction, and that the word Armstrong was exactly the word remaining, he must at once have communicated his news, to the others. It was at this minute that the position of Countess Andrenyi became acute, and her husband immediately took steps to alter the passport. It was their second piece of bad luck!</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“They one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the Armstrong family. They knew I had no immediate means of finding out the truth, and they did not believe that I should go into the matter unless my suspicions were aroused against one particular person.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“Now there was one further point to consider. Allowing that my theory of the crime was the correct one, and I believed that it <SPAN class="ft4">must </SPAN>be the correct one, then obviously the Wagon Lit conductor himself must be privy to the plot. But if so, that gave us thirteen persons, not twelve. Instead of the usual formula ‘Of so many people one is guilty,’ I was faced with the problem that of thirteen persons one and one only was innocent. Which was that person?</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“I came to a very odd conclusion. I came to the conclusion that the person who had taken no part in the crime was the person who would be considered the most likely to do so. I refer to Countess Andrenyi. I was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me solemnly on his honour that his wife never left her compartment that night. I decided that Count Andrenyi took, so to speak, his wife’s place.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“If so, then Pierre Michel was definitely one of the twelve. But how could one explain his complicity? He was a decent man who had been many years in the employ of the <NOBR>company—not</NOBR> the kind of man who could be bribed to assist in a crime. Then Pierre Michel must be involved in the Armstrong case. But that seemed very improbable. Then I remembered that the dead nursery- maid had been French. Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel’s daughter. That would explain <NOBR>everything—it</NOBR> would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the crime. Were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear? Colonel Arbuthnot I put down as a friend of the Armstrongs. They had probably been through the War together. The maid, Hildegarde <NOBR>Schmidt—I</NOBR> could guess her place in the Armstrong household. I am, perhaps, over greedy, but I sense a good cook instinctively. I laid a trap for <NOBR>her—she</NOBR> fell into it. I said I knew she was a good cook. She answered: ‘Yes, indeed, all my ladies have said so.’ But if you are employed as a <NOBR><SPAN class="ft22">lady’s-maid</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft22"> </SPAN>your employers seldom have a chance of learning whether or not you are a good cook.</P>
<P class="p494 ft3">“Then there was Hardman. He seemed quite definitely not to belong to the Armstrong household. I could only imagine that he had been in love with the French girl. I spoke to him of the charm of foreign <NOBR>women—and</NOBR> again I obtained the reaction I was looking for. Sudden tears came into his eyes, which he pretended were dazzled by the snow.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“There remains Mrs. Hubbard. Now Mrs. Hubbard, let me say, played the most important part in the drama. By occupying the compartment communicating with that of Ratchett she was more open to suspicion than anyone else. In the nature of things she could not have an alibi to fall back upon. To play the part she <NOBR>played—the</NOBR> perfectly natural, slightly ridiculous American fond</P>

<P class="p151 ft23"><NOBR>mother—an</NOBR> artist was needed. But there <SPAN class="ft24">was </SPAN>an artist connected with the Armstrong family: Mrs. Armstrong’s <NOBR>mother—Linda</NOBR> Arden, the actress . ...”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">He stopped.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Then in a soft rich dreamy voice, quite unlike the one she had used throughout the journey, Mrs. Hubbard said:</P>
<P class="p496 ft5">“I always fancied myself in comedy parts.” She went on, still dreamily:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">“That slip about the <NOBR>sponge-bag</NOBR> was silly. It shows that you should always rehearse property. We tried it on the way <NOBR>out—I</NOBR> was in an <NOBR>even-number</NOBR> compartment then, I suppose. I never thought of the bolts being in different places.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft3">She shifted her position a little and looked straight at Poirot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“You know all about it, M. Poirot. You’re a very wonderful man. But even you can’t quite imagine what it was <NOBR>like—that</NOBR> awful day in New York. I was just crazy with grief; so were the servants. And Colonel Arbuthnot was there too. He was John Armstrong’s best friend.”</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">“He saved my life in the War,” said Arbuthnot.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“We decided then and there (perhaps we were <NOBR>mad—I</NOBR> don’t know) that the sentence of death that Cassetti had escaped had got to be carried out. There were twelve of <NOBR>us—or</NOBR> rather eleven; Susanne’s father was over in France, of course. First we thought we’d draw lots as to who should do it, but in the end we decided on this way. It was the chauffeur, Antonio, who suggested it. Mary worked out all the details later with Hector MacQueen. He’d always adored <NOBR>Sonia—my</NOBR> <NOBR>daughter—and</NOBR> it was he who explained to us exactly how Cassetti’s money had managed to get him off.</P>
<P class="p497 ft5">“It took a long time to perfect our plan. We had first to track Ratchett down. Hardman managed that in the end. Then we had to try and get Masterman and Hector into his <NOBR>employment—or</NOBR> at any rate one of them. Well, we managed that. Then we had a consultation with Susanne’s father. Colonel Arbuthnot was very keen on having twelve of us. He seemed to think it made it more in order. He didn’t like the stabbing idea much, but he agreed that it did solve most of our difficulties. Well, Susanne’s father was willing. Susanne had been his only child. We knew from Hector that Ratchett would be coming back from the East sooner or later by the Orient Express. With Pierre Michel actually working on that train, the chance was too good to be missed. Besides, it would be a good way of not incriminating any outsiders.</P>
<P class="p498 ft5">“My daughter’s husband had to know, of course, and he insisted on coming on the train with her. Hector wangled it so that Ratchett selected the right day for travelling, when Michel would be on duty. We meant to engage every carriage in the <NOBR>Stamboul-Calais</NOBR> coach, but unfortunately there was one carriage we couldn’t get. It had been reserved long beforehand for a director of the company. ‘Mr. Harris,’ of course, was a myth. But it would have been awkward to have any stranger in Hector’s compartment. And then, at the last minute, <SPAN class="ft4">you </SPAN>came. ...”</P>
<P class="p125 ft3">She stopped.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">“Well,” she said, “you know everything now, M. Poirot. What are you going to do about it? If it must all come out, can’t you lay the blame upon me and me only? I would have stabbed that man twelve times willingly. It wasn’t only that he was responsible for my daughter’s death and her child’s and that of the other child who might have been alive and happy now. It was more than that: there had been other children kidnapped before Daisy, and there might be others in the future. Society had condemned <NOBR>him—we</NOBR> were only carrying out the sentence. But it’s unnecessary to bring all these others into it. All these good faithful <NOBR>souls—and</NOBR> poor <NOBR>Michel-and</NOBR> Mary and Colonel <NOBR>Arbuthnot—they</NOBR> love each other. ...”</P>

<P class="p391 ft5">“You are a director of the company, M. Bouc,” he said. “What do you say?” M. Bouc cleared his throat.</P>
